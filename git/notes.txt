architecture

when you clone a repository, you get a local copy of everything (history, commits, ...)
your local copy is completly separate from the remote one, unless you connect the two (push, pull)
git does its work inside .git folder.
staged means you commit something, it's like stand-by for final change.
the staging area and git index are the same thing.
the lifecycle of the status of your files:
	untracked
	unmodified
	modified
	staged
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
repo naming convention

there's not really a standard, but lowercase-names-seprated-with-hyphens is the prefered one.

3 commands with similar names:

git revert
	making a new commit that reverts the changes made by other commits

git reset
	updating your branch, moving the tip in order to add or remove commits from the branch
	changes the commit history
	also can restore the index (overlapping with git restore)

git restore
	restoring files in the working tree from either the index or another commit
	does not update your branch.
	also can restore files in the index from another commit
