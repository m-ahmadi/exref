architecture

when you clone a repository, you get a local copy of everything (history, commits, ...)
your local copy is completly separate from the remote one, unless you connect the two (push, pull)
git does its work inside .git folder.
staged means you commit something, it's like stand-by for final change.
the staging area and git index are the same thing.
the lifecycle of the status of your files:
	untracked
	unmodified
	modified
	staged

repo naming convention

there's not really a standard, but lowercase-names-seprated-with-hyphens is the prefered one.
