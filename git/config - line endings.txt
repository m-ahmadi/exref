Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings:

	When committing text files, CRLF will be converted to LF.
	For cross-platform projects, this is the recommended setting on Windows.
	("core.autocrlf" is set to "true")

Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings:

Cloned vs. zip-download line endings

cloned repo (via "git clone") line-ending is based on global config core.autocrlf
zip-downloaded repo line-ending is based on original repo env (usually lf)
