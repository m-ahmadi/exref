undo (removes) commits and unstage changes

git reset HEAD~			reset last commit (goes back one by one)
git reset --hard HEAD		reset last commit (not sure if this is exactly equal to above command)

git reset <commit_hash>		reset to specific commit (resets commit history but not the files)
git reset --hard <commit_hash>	... (also resets the files)
