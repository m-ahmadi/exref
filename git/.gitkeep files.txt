git automaticaly removes empty folders when pushing.
to keep an empty folder in git repository, convention is to add an empty (hidden) file to that directory.

not a feature of git.

because git can't track empty directories,
people created the convention of putting files called .gitkeep in empty directories they want to track.

the file could be called anything, git assigns no special significance to this name.
