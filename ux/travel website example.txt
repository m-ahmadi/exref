mike cohn notes for a travel website

As a user, I want to reserve a hotel room.

As a user, I want to cancel a reservation.

As a vacation traveler, I want to see photos of the hotels.
	embeding the type of user in the story, so it can provide some context
	maybe a business traveler, doesn't care to see photos of hotels beforehand

As a frequent flyer, I want to rebook a past trip.
	could begs the question that, why would someone rebook a past trip?, since obviously the date of the trip will not be the same.
	sometimes a story doesn't make sense until we add a <so that> clause:
So that I save time booking trips I take often.
	It's like going to a coffee shop and say give me the usual.
	Of course the date has to be different!

Where are the details in these stories?


write details as conditions of satisfaction (maybe in the back of the card)
	essentially high-level test cases/acceptance test
	conditions of satisfaction is a better phrase to tell product owners

or in smaller sub-stories


conditions of satisfaction and sub-stories, are 2 different techniques, and the result form of them is different:
	conditions of satisfaction, on the back of card
	sub-stories, end up with more stories
but they both solve the same problem

product backlog

small detailed things on the top of the backlog
	they come in the next sprint/iteration
	they have to be small enough, we can do them in the next couple of weeks

the bottom stories are
	stuff we might not do for 6 months or a year
	big and vague

example of a bottom story, for a travel website, that does not support cruise ships
	As a traveler, I want to book a cabin on a cruise ship
