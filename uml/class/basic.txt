A class diagram describes the types of objects in the system and the various kinds of static
relationships that exist among them. Class diagrams also show the properties and operations of a
class and the constraints that apply to the way objects are connected. The UML uses the term
feature as a general term that covers properties and operations of a class.

The biggest danger with class diagrams is that you can focus exclusively on structure and ignore
behavior. Therefore, when drawing class diagrams to understand software, always do them in
conjunction with some form of behavioral technique. If you're going well, you'll find yourself
swapping between the techniques frequently.
