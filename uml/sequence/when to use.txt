You should use sequence diagrams when you want to look at the behavior of several objects within a single use case.

Sequence diagrams are good at showing collaborations among the objects; they
are not so good at precise definition of the behavior.

If you want to look at the behavior of a single object across many use cases, use a state diagram.

If you want to look at behavior across many use cases or many threads, consider an activity diagram.

If you want to explore multiple alternative interactions quickly, you may be better off with CRC
cards, as that avoids a lot of drawing and erasing.

It's often handy to have a CRC card session to explore design alternatives and then
use sequence diagrams to capture any interactions that you want to refer to later

Other useful forms of interaction diagrams are communication diagrams, for showing connections;
and timing diagrams, for showing timing constraints.
