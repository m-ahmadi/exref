A common issue with sequence diagrams is how to show looping and conditional behavior.
The first thing to point out is that this isn't what sequence diagrams are good at.
If you want to show control structures, you are better off with an activity diagram.
Treat sequence diagrams as a visualization of how objects interact rather than as a way of modeling control logic.

UML 1 used iteration markers and guards. An iteration marker is a * added to the message name.
You can add some text in square brackets to indicate the basis of the iteration.
While these notations have been dropped from sequence diagrams in UML 2,
they are still legal on communication diagrams.
