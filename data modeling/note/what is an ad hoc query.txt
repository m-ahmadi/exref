Ad hoc is latin for "for this purpose".
You might call it an "on the fly" query, or a "just so" query.
It's the kind of SQL query you just loosely type out where you need it,

var newSqlQuery = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ${myId};";

which is an entirely different query each time that line of code is executed,
depending on the value of myId.

The opposite of an ad hoc query is a predefined query such as a Stored Procedure,
where you have created a single query for the entire generalized purpose of selecting from that table (say),
and pass the ID as a variable.
