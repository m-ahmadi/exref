how py launcher default python version changes after executing an installer

first, there is the installer file e.g. python-3.12.4-amd64.exe
the installer automatically installs another program called "Python Launcher" (gives us `py` cli)
for every version of the installer, there is a version of PL associated with it
if run an installer with lower  version than installed, it does not install its PL
if run an installer with higher version than installed, it will     install its PL (multiple PLs)
	only if PL version of installer is higher than installed PL
the `py` cli of the higher version of PL installed always takes precedence
even after uninstalling python itself with installer, PL sticks around
the py.exe file from PL, is put in %windir% (unless checked "py launcher" during install, which puts it in %localappdata%\...)

two ways that running an installer affects the default version:
	1. once a new PL version is installed                                       (changes default to its associated python version)
	2. once an existing PL version is uninstalled, while a lower version exists (changes default to that lower version)
	(both 3.8 and 3.9 installed, then uninstall 3.9, now default is 3.8)

TLDR:
default only changes when the default PL is changed
default PL changes in an upward-aware manner:
	high on low  = change
	low  on high = no change
