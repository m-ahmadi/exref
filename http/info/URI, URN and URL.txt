URI

Each web server resource has a name,
so clients can point out what resources they are interested in.

The server resource name is called
	uniform resource identifier, URI

URIs come in two flavors (types of resource identifiers)
	URL
	URN

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
URL

The uniform resource locator (URL) is the most common form of resource identifier.

URLs describe the specific location of a resource on a particular server.

They tell you exactly how to fetch a resource from a precise, fixed location.

Most URLs follow a standardized format of three main parts:

	• The first part of the URL is called the scheme,
	and it describes the protocol used to access the resource.
	This is usually the HTTP protocol (http://).

	• The second part gives the server Internet address (www.joes-hardware.com).
	
	• The rest names a resource on the web server (/specials/saw-blade.gif ).
	Today, almost every URI is a URL.

URN


The second flavor of URI is the uniform resource name, or URN.

A URN serves as a unique name for a particular piece of content,
independent of where the resource currently resides.

These location-independent URNs allow resources to move from place to place.

URNs also allow resources to be accessed by multiple
network access protocols while maintaining the same name.

For example 
the following URN might be used to name “RFC 2141” document
regardless of where it resides (it may even be copied in several places):
	urn:ietf:rfc:2141

URNs are still experimental and not yet widely adopted.

To work effectively, URNs need a supporting infrastructure to resolve resource locations;
the lack of such an infrastructure has also slowed their adoption.
But URNs do hold some exciting promise for the future.
