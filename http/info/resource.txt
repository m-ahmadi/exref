Web servers host web resources.

A web resource is the source of web content.

The simplest kind of web resource is a static file on the web server’s filesystem.

These files can contain anything:
	text files
	HTML files
	Microsoft Word files
	Adobe Acrobat files
	JPEG image files
	AVI movie files
	any other format

Resources don’t have to be static files.
Resources can also be software programs that generate content on demand.

These dynamic content resources can generate content based
	on your identity
	on what information you’ve requested
	on the time of day
They can
	show you a live image from a camera
	let you trade stocks
	search real estate databases
	buy gifts from online stores

In summary, a resource is any kind of content source.
	A file containing your company’s sales forecast spreadsheet is a resource.
	A web gateway to scan your local public library’s shelves is a resource.
	An Internet search engine is a resource.
