Media Types
Because the Internet hosts many thousands of different data types,
HTTP carefully tags each object being transported through the Web with a
data format label called a MIME type. (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)

Web servers attach a MIME type to all HTTP object data.

When a web browser gets an object back from a server,
it looks at the associated MIME type to see if it knows how to handle the object.

Most browsers can handle hundreds of popular object types:
	displaying image files
	parsing and formatting HTML files
	playing audio files through the computer’s speakers
	launching external plug-in software to handle special formats

MIME type
	Content-type: image/jpeg
	Content-length: 12984


A MIME type is a textual label,
represented as a primary object type and a specific subtype, separated by a slash.

For example:
	text/html				An HTML-formatted text document
	text/plain				A plain ASCII text document
	image/jpeg				A JPEG version of an image
	image/gif				A GIF-format image
	video/quicktime				An Apple QuickTime movie
	application/vnd.ms-powerpoint		A Microsoft PowerPoint presentation

There are hundreds of popular MIME types, and many more experimental or limiteduse types.

A very thorough MIME type list is provided in Appendix D.
