Communication between servers and clients happens with,
formatted blocks of data called HTTP messages. (request & response)

structure of HTTP request and response messages:

HTTP messages are simple, line-oriented sequences of characters.

Because they are plain text, not binary, they are easy for humans to read and write.


request  messages		Messages sent from   clients   to   servers
response messages		Messages sent from   servers   to   clients

There are no other kinds of HTTP messages.


HTTP messages consist of three parts:
Start line
	The first line of the message is the start line,
	indicating what to do for a request or what happened for a response.

Header fields
	Zero or more header fields follow the start line.
	Each header field consists of a name and a value,
	separated by a colon (:) for easy parsing.
	The headers end with a blank line.

Body
	After the blank line is an optional message body containing any kind of data.
	Request bodies carry data to web server;
	response bodies carry data back to client.
	Unlike the start lines and headers, which are textual and structured,
	the body can contain arbitrary binary data (e.g., images, videos, audio tracks,
	software applications). Of course, the body can also contain text.
