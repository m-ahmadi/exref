so when browsers send request you don't see the raw request
when:

http://www.site.com/test.htm

browser changes it to
	GET /test.htm HTTP/1.1
	Host: www.site.com

and when response returns you don't see all of it either
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Date: Wed, 27 Apr 2016 16:25:19 GMT
	Server: Apache/2.4.17 (Win32) OpenSSL/1.0.2d PHP/5.6.19
	X-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.19
	Content-Length: 5
	Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

	fudge

you only see the body of response message in browsers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
				end of line

new line characters play an important part in request and response

end of line in linux	\n
end of line in windows	\r\n

so depending on which os you're on,
it gets added to the request and response messages

windows
	GET /test.htm HTTP/1.1\r\n
	Host: www.site.com\r\n\r\n
linux
	GET /test.htm HTTP/1.1\n
	Host: www.site.com\n\n
