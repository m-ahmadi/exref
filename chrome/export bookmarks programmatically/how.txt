chrome bookmarks are stored in an extensionless file with json format:

%localappdata%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Bookmarks

and there's a Bookmark.bak as well which is a backup file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
method 1

export:  make a copy of the `Bookmark` file
import:  replace `Bookmark` file in original path with your copy (then restart chrome)

issues:
	everytime you visit a bookmark:
		its "date_last_used" property is updated
		the "date_modified" property of its parent folder is also updated
	everytime you add a bookmark:
		its "date_added" property is updated
	
	they can be fixed by unsetting these properties in the file before copying it
	the script .\copyraw-unsetdate.js does this exact thing

import in another browser:
	1. import using the mentioned method above
	2. export using chrome's ui (ctrl shif o) to get `.html` file
	3. use `.html` file to import in another browser
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
method 2
using a powershell script that takes the Bookmark file from chrome,
and converts its content from json to html and writes a new .html file.

requires powershell 3 or higher
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\file.ps1
pwsh -File ./convert.ps1	(powershell 6)

drawback
the file created by convert.ps1 is not exactly equal to the file exported by chrome
diffs:
  some tags are different
  chrome outputs ICON attr with data uris (ICON="data:image/png;base64,...) while this script does not

but it works. (imported and tested, could icons be affected on a new chrome install?)
