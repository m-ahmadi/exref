chrome bookmarks are stored in an extensionless file with json format:

%localappdata%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Bookmarks

and there's a Bookmark.bak as well which is a backup file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
method 1
using a powershell script that takes the Bookmark file from chrome,
and converts its content from json to html and writes a new .html file.

requires powershell 3 or higher
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\file.ps1
pwsh -File ./convert.ps1	(powershell 6)

drawback
the file created by convert.ps1 is not exactly equal to the file exported by chrome
diffs:
  some tags are different
  chrome outputs ICON attr with data uris (ICON="data:image/png;base64,...) while this script does not

but it works. (imported and tested, could icons be affected on a new chrome install?)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
method 2

just copy and paste the Bookmark file in its path on another computer.
(not sure how to import from it)

drawback
you can only move your bookmarks to another chrome, not firefox etc.
