attribute/col in one table that refers to primary key of another table (two tables are linked)

TEAM.MEMBER_NAME	foreign key ->		PERSON.PERSON_NAME

	any TEAM.MEMBER_NAME value must ALSO exist in PERSON.PERSON_NAME

foreign key relationship involves a parent-table and a child-table
	parent table holds central values
	child  table holds identical values pointing back to parent

memory trick
	foreign key always exist on child table/entity (car->engine_fk)
	table with foreign key is "many" side of "one-to-many" relationship
	in sql, the FOREIGN KEY clause is specified on child table

foreign key constraint
	dbms rejects any INSERT/UPDATE to create fkcol value in child-table if matching candidatekey value not exist in parent-table

example

person
  job		(fk -> person pk)
    location	(fk -> job    pk)
    type	(fk -> job    pk)
    salary	(fk -> job    pk)
  eyes		(fk -> person pk)
    color	(fk -> eyes   pk)
    vision	(fk -> eyes   pk)
  email		(fk -> person pk)
