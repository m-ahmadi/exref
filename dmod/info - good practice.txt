upping the max_connections
tuning the sql
properly closing the connections as soon as you are finished with them
or never closing the connections

having proper indexes on the db tables:
	any WHERE clause should be indexed
	make sure indexes that exist are valid
	an index on the wrong column can easily bring a db down to its knees
	bring back the minimum of rows that you need, when searching on a table
