3 different types of data models, while progressing from requirements to the actual database:

conceptual
	highly abstract (not too much detail)
	square for entity, lines for relations
	abstract relationships
	no attributes for entities
	no software tool is required

logical
	presence of attributes for each entity
	key attributes (those that define the uniqueness of the entity, eg: in time: date)
	non-key attributes (seperated below the line in entity's square)
	"primary key - foreign key" relationships
	user friendly attribute names
	database agnostic
	a bit more effort required to enhance, in comparison to conceptual model

physical
	entities referred to as tables
	attribute referred to as columns
	database compatible table names
	database compatible column names
	database specific data types
	significantly more effort required to enhance in comparison to logical model

cardinality
	one-to-one
