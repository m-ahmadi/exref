3 different types of data models, while progressing from requirements to the actual database:

conceptual
	highly abstract (not too much detail)
	square for entity, lines for relations
	abstract relationships
	no attributes for entities
	no software tool is required

logical
	presence of attributes for each entity
	key attributes (those that define the uniqueness of the entity, eg: in time: date)
	non-key attributes (seperated below the line in entity's square)
	"primary key - foreign key" relationships
	user friendly attribute names
	database agnostic
	a bit more effort required to enhance, in comparison to conceptual model

physical
	entities referred to as tables
	attribute referred to as columns
	database compatible table names
	database compatible column names
	database specific data types
	significantly more effort required to enhance in comparison to logical model
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cardinality
	one-to-one
	one-to-many
	many-to-many

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
normalization

removing anomalies from database

insertion anomaly
	a record cannot be entered because some data is missing
updating anomaly
	same data stored in more than one place
	every time update multiple places
	inconsistent data over time (multiple source of truth)
	
deletion anomaly
	deleting a record accidently causes loss of other data

normal forms: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, 4NF
