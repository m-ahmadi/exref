no generic answer (heavily dependent on situations)

how data is consumed?
	reading from start to end rows in the order entered?
	searching for rows that match multiple criteria?

how often data is accessed during program lifecycle?
	once to get all books of an author?
	several times to get different authors?
	several times per author for different criteria?

how often data is added?
	append row to end is enough for retrieval?
	specific rows need to be retrieved?

how logical the code looks in future? (emphasized)
	after six months, which way of storing and retrieving data makes more sense?
	if db is 1% more efficient, but adds code complexity, have you really improved?
