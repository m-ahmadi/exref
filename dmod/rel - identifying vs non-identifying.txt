identifying

existence of child-table row depends on parent-table row
child cannot exist without parent
child's foreignkey is part of its primarykey

bad:	pseudokey on child-table with no foreignkey to parent part of child-table primarykey
good:	make foreignkey part of child-table primarykey


example 1
book has author
author has books
but book must have author (cannot exist without an author)

example 2
one person one phone_number (column of table)
	person.phone_number
one person many phone_numbers (separate table)
	person.phone_number = phone_number.id
	phone_number.person_id == person_id
phone_number belongs to a person (even though modeled as attrs of separate table)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
non-identifying

parent primarykey attribute must not become child primarykey attribute

optional:  foreignkey column allows    NULL
mandatory: foreignkey column disallows NULL


example 1
book has owner
owner has book
but book can exist without owner and it can change owner

example 2
state has many persons (person.state -fk-> states.state)
but state is not part of person primarykey (person row not identified by its state)
