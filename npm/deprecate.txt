by deprecating, you don't delete the package, rather you notify people.

npm deprecate <pkg>[@<version>] <message>
npm deprecate <pkg> "<message>"				deprecate entire package
npm deprecate <pkg>@<version> "<message>"		deprecate specific version

to remove package from your profile, transfer it to @npm account:
	npm owner add npm <package>
	npm owner rm <your_username> <package>
