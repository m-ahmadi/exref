forex market:
	world's largest and most liquid financial market
	highly decentralized and fragmented
	trading is done through a network of banks, financial institutions, and online platforms, not a centralized exchange
	lacks a centralized source of trading data and pricing information (nature of otc markets)
	two trading venues can have differet data for prices, trading volumes, market depth data and historical data.

broker:		company providing the platform to buy and sell things
account:	broker's trading account
deposit:	money transferred into broker's trading account
margin:		real money in account, gained either through deposit or profit made in deals
balance:	margin in account. updates only at specific points in time: deposit, withdrawal, after closing all positions
equity:		balance + unrealised net profit & loss (amount of margin if close all positions now)
used margin:	margin involved in positions
free margin:	equity - used margin, remaining margin, after taking into account state of positions
margin level:	used margin / equity, determines the level that "margin call" and "stop out" are compared to
currency pair:	quotation of two currencies, one against the other, first one is "base currency", second one is "quote currency"

	terms
	position:			means an opened position (cuz "closed position" is called deal or trade)
	unrealised net profit & loss:	sum of profit/loss of all still open positions
	realised net profit & loss:	sum of profit/loss of all closed positions (or deals)

leverage:
	feature of broker's trading account
	pretend borrowed money that is not allowed to partake in positions's loss
	makes it possible to trade forex contracts with fraction of real money needed
	has no effect on position loss/gain
	only affects how much real money is needed to enter position
	example:
	leverage	real money needed to buy 0.01 lot of XAU/USD at 2651.64
	1:1		2651.64 $
	1:10		265.164 $
	1:100		26.5164 $
	1:1000		2.65164 $

lot:
	unit of base currency used for measuring trade volume (how much base currency equals to 1 lot)
	depenging on the broker and the market, 1 lot might equal different quantity of things
	when opening a position, amount of volume for position is expressed in lot (actual $ value depends on currency pair)
	lot used in position, has effects on pip value and "margin level" (tolerable loss for position)
	example:
	let's say there are 3 brokers and you are trading EUR/USD
	broker A sets 1 lot equal to 100,000 EUR
	broker B sets 1 lot equal to  10,000 EUR
	broker C sets 1 lot equal to   1,000 EUR
	now `lot = 0.01` will equal to:
	1,000 EUR in broker A
	100 EUR in broker B
	10 EUR in broker C

margin call:
	a threshold level for the "margin level" of account
	if "margin level" of account falls to this level, broker asks to deposit more margin into account to keep position open
	enforced by broker
	actual number of the threshold level depends on broker and type of trading account
	sometimes it is referred to inversely, so 20% is referred to as 80%

stop out:
	same as "margin call", except at this level, all positions are closed automatically

pip:
	smallest decimal place of price
	most symbols have 4 decimal places i.e. 0.0000
	so if EURUSD goes from 1.0000 to 1.0001 it has moved up 1 pip
	an exception is "japanese yen" which has 2 decimal places, or XAU/USD which is the same

pipette:
	tenth of a pip
	1 pipette = pip / 10
	some brokers quote currency pairs beyound standard 4 and 2 decimal places to 5 and 3
	in other word, they are quoting "fractional pips", aka "points" or "pipettes"

pip value:
	USD as quote currency:
		pip value = value traded * quote currency pip
		e.g. for EUR/USD:	10,000 * 0.0001 = 1
	USD as base currency:
		pip value = traded value * (pip size / exchange rate)
		e.g. for USD/CAD:	100,000 * (0.0001 / 1.4377) = 6.9556

market hours:
	open:	monday	 02:30		(sunday night)
	close:	saturday 00:30		(friday night)
