forex market:
	world's largest and most liquid financial market
	highly decentralized and fragmented
	trading is done through a network of banks, financial institutions, and online platforms, not a centralized exchange
	lacks a centralized source of trading data and pricing information (nature of otc markets)
	two trading venues can have different data for prices, trading volumes, market depth data and historical data.

broker:		company providing the platform to buy and sell things
account:	broker's trading account
deposit:	money transferred into broker's trading account
margin:		real money in account, gained either through deposit or profit made in deals
balance:	margin in account. updates only at specific points in time: deposit, withdrawal, after closing all positions
equity:		balance + unrealised net profit & loss (amount of margin if close all positions now)
used margin:	margin involved in positions
free margin:	equity - used margin, remaining margin, after taking into account state of positions
margin level:	used margin / equity, determines the level that "margin call" and "stop out" are compared to
currency pair:	quotation of two currencies, one against the other, first one is "base currency", second one is "quote currency"

	terms
	position:			means an opened position (cuz "closed position" is called deal or trade)
	unrealised net profit & loss:	sum of profit/loss of all still open positions
	realised net profit & loss:	sum of profit/loss of all closed positions (or deals)

contract:
	an important concept in forex (and other markets too)
	a framework for trading the assets in the market
	common types of contracts: futures, options, forward, CFD (common in forex)
	a contract is a standardized quantity of something that is traded for something else in return
	a contract consists of 3 things:
		base asset		what is being given at what price
		quote asset		what is being taken in its place at what price
		contract size		amount of base asset that one contract represents
	who and what defines what the asset is depends on market, broker, and account type
	common assets are: currency, commodity, financial instrument
	in forex, a contract consists of:
		base currency		a currency at specific price, trader,
		quote currency		for another currency at its specific price
		contract size		how much base currency equals 1 contract (1 contract =  1 lot)

leverage:
	feature of broker's trading account
	pretend borrowed money that is not allowed to partake in positions's loss
	makes it possible to trade forex contracts with fraction of real money needed
	has no effect on position loss/gain
	only affects how much real money is needed to enter position
	example:
	leverage	real money needed to buy 0.01 lot of XAU/USD at 2651.64
	1:1		2651.64 $
	1:10		265.164 $
	1:100		26.5164 $
	1:1000		2.65164 $

lot:
	aka "contract size"
	how trade volume is expressed and measured in forex (and other markets)
	essential in understanding leverage
	volume in forex is not called volume, it's called "contract size" (1 lot = 1 contract)
	lot size defines how much base currency equals to 1 lot
	lot size can vary depending on market, broker, or account type
		LOT_TYPE	LOT_SIZE
		standard	100,000
		mini		 10,000
		micro		  1,000
		nano		    100
	when opening a position, amount of volume for position is expressed in lot (actual $ value depends on currency pair)
	lot used in position, has effects on pip value and "margin level" (tolerable loss for position)
	
	example:			trade value for 0.01 lot of EUR/USD
	in broker with lot standard:	1000 €
	in broker with lot mini:	100 €
	in broker with lot micro:	10 €

margin call:
	a threshold level for the "margin level" of account
	if "margin level" of account falls to this level, broker asks to deposit more margin into account to keep position open
	enforced by broker
	actual number of the threshold level depends on broker and type of trading account
	sometimes it is referred to inversely, so 20% is referred to as 80%

stop out:
	same as "margin call", except at this level, all positions are closed automatically

pip:
	smallest decimal place of price
	most symbols have 4 decimal places i.e. 0.0000
	so if EURUSD goes from 1.0000 to 1.0001 it has moved up 1 pip
	an exception is "japanese yen" which has 2 decimal places, or XAU/USD which is the same

pipette:
	tenth of a pip
	1 pipette = pip / 10
	some brokers quote currency pairs beyond standard 4 and 2 decimal places to 5 and 3
	in other word, they are quoting "fractional pips", aka "points" or "pipettes"

pip value:
	USD as quote currency:
		pip value = value traded * quote currency pip
		e.g. for EUR/USD:	10,000 * 0.0001 = 1
	USD as base currency:
		pip value = traded value * (pip size / exchange rate)
		e.g. for USD/CAD:	100,000 * (0.0001 / 1.4377) = 6.9556

market hours:
	open:	monday	 02:30		(sunday night)
	close:	saturday 00:30		(friday night)
