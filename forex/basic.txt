deposit:
	amount of money transferred into broker's trading account

balance:
	total amount of money in broker's trading account

leverage:
	feature of broker's trading account
	determines value of each pip

lot:
	lot is a unit of base currency used for measuring trade volume
	it is set by the broker
	example:
	let's say there are 3 brokers and you are trading EUR/USD
	broker A sets 1 lot equal to 100,000 EUR
	broker B sets 1 lot equal to  10,000 EUR
	broker C sets 1 lot equal to   1,000 EUR
	now `lot = 0.01` will equal to:
	1,000 EUR in broker A
	  100 EUR in broker B
	   10 EUR in broker C

margin call:
	a % level of account's balance
	if reached, broker asks for additional deposit to keep position opened
	closely relates to amount of leverage set for the account
	enforced by broker
	actual % depends on broker and type of trading account

stop out:
	a % level of account's balance
	if reached, all positions are closed automatically by broker
	closely relates to amount of leverage set for the account
	enforced by broker
	actual % depends on broker and type of trading account

pip:
	pip just means smallest decimal place of price
	most symbols have 4 decimal places i.e. 0.0000
	so if EURUSD goes from 1.0000 to 1.0001 it has moved up 1 pip
	only exception is "japanese yen" which has 2 decimal places

pipette:
	tenth of a pip
	1 pipette = pip / 10
	some brokers quote currency pairs beyound standard 4 and 2 decimal places to 5 and 3
	in other word, they are quoting "fractional pips", aka "points" or "pipettes"

most important thing about leverage
leverage determines how much negative % a position can tolerate before triggering "stop out"

balance:	100$
margin call:	70%
stop out:	80% (usually referred to inversely i.e. 20% for this example)
lot:		1 (entered position with 1 lot)

leverage:					1:1	1:10	1:100	1:1000
value of +1% price chg:				1$	10$	100$	1000$
max % price can fall before "margin call":	-70%	-7%	-0.7%	-0.07%
max % price can fall before "stop out":		-80%	-8%	-0.8%	-0.08%
% price must rise to profit 50$:		50%	5%	0.5%	0.05%
