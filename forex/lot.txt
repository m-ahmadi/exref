lot is a unit of base currency used for measuring trade volume
it is set by the broker

example:

let's say there are 3 brokers and you are trading EUR/USD

broker A sets 1 lot equal to 100,000 EUR
broker B sets 1 lot equal to  10,000 EUR
broker C sets 1 lot equal to   1,000 EUR

now `lot = 0.01` will equal to:

1,000 EUR in broker A
  100 EUR in broker B
   10 EUR in broker C
