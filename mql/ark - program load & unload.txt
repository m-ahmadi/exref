	call to ExpertRemove() function
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
scripts

load
	atach to chart
unload
	after operation is complete


note

deinit in other program types means:
	delete global variables and events queue
deinit in context of scripts means:
	reset of all the string-type variables
	deallocation of dynamical array objects and calling their destructors if they have one
	note: OnInit(), OnDeinit() are not called for scripts, here we mean what happens in background
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
services

loaded
	terminal start (if launched previously before terminal shutdown)
unloaded
	immediately after completing their work


note
services must have `#property service` directive
endless loop inside OnStart() is a common pattern (e.g. data reciving and handling)
unlike other program types, a service does not need to be atached to a chart to run

manage of service:
	create new instance:		Navigator -> Services -> rclick on service -> Add Service
	start|stop|remove instance:	Navigator -> Services -> rclick on service
	manage all instances		service menu
