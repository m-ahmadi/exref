If you get your css through customizer, even if you don't change anything,
It's not the same as using the original css files that come with the download:
	/uikit.css
	/uikit.almost-flat.css
	/uikit.gradient.css
	/etc

for example:
	form radio and checkbox don't have any style in original build,
	and you have to include "form-advanced.css" component,
	but using customizer css, it's already included.

another example:
	progress is not included in the original css files,
	and you have to include /components/progress.css,
	but it's already inlcuded in customizer css.
