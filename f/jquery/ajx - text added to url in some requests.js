/*
	cache (default: true, false for dataType 'script' and 'jsonp')
	Type: Boolean
	If set to false, it will force requested pages not to be cached by the browser.
	Note: Setting cache to false will only work correctly with HEAD and GET requests.
	It works by appending '_={timestamp}' to the GET parameters.
	The parameter is not needed for other types of requests,
	except in IE8 when a POST is made to a URL that has already been requested by a GET.
