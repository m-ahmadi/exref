This is what I think based on my knowledge so far:

It doesn't matter,
the first time requirejs sees that module, it checks to see if it's loaded,
if it's not loaded, then it loades the module,
after the first time, if you reference a module that's already loaded,
it just gives access to the module and will not try to load it again.
