There is no direct method.
The sending application is not captured along with the traffic.

While most applications do have a "signature" to their traffic, (e.g. by port use or specific data in each packet, and Wireshark uses this to perform dissection of the respective traffic.)
it's likely that the traffic for the applications you have listed will be encrypted and
it's very difficult to determine what application sent any specific encrypted packet.
