moving average:
	is an average of a certain body of data.
	identifies if a new trend has begun or an old trend has ended or reversed.
	is a follower, not a leader.
	never anticipates, it only reacts.
	is not a curving trendline.
	functions in the same senses that standard chart analysis do.
	smoothes the data, making the underlying trend clearer.
	by its nature, lags the market action. (less lag with shorter averages, but never completely eliminated)

commonly used time frames
	10-20		short term
	50		mid   term
	200		long  term

which prices to use
	close		most common
	midpoint	dividing the day's range by two: median(high,low) aka `midrange` in statistics
	hlc		high + low + close / 3
	price-bands	average of high and low separately (volatility buffer or neutral zone)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
types of moving averages:

basic types: simple, weighted, exponential

simple moving average
	average of last N days
	criticism:
		only the period covered by the average is taken into account
		it gives equal weight to each day (some say more recent days should weight heavier)

linearly weighted
	weighted average of last N days
	(1st day * 1) + ... + (10th day * 10) / sum_of_weights=55
	criticism:
		only the period covered by the average is taken into account

exponentially smoothed
	weighted average of all previous day (different weights for the days though)
	weight of last day depends on the number of periods in the moving average
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
usage

generate trend signals
	buy  signal:		when close price moves above moving average
	sell signal:		when close price moves below moving average
	extra confirmation:	if moving average line itself turns in direction of the price crossing

short average (5|10)
	very sensitive and tracks price very closely so several crossings occur
	the shorter the average, the closer it follows the price trend
	generates earlier signals in the move
	works better when trend is in the process of reversing
	
	produces more trades (higher commission)
	results in many false signals (whipsaws)
	random price movement (noise) activates bad trend signals
	
long average
	tracks price from a greater distance
	does not get tangled up in short term corrections during the trend
	works better as long as the trend remains in force
	
	its insensitivity works against the trader when trend actually reverses

finding an average sensitive enough to generate early signals but insensitive enough to avoid most noises is a tradeoff
using only one moving average has several disadvantages and it's best to use two
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
centering the average

plotting a moving average in middle of the time period it covers (instead of at end)
	10 day average		5  days back
	20 day average 		10 days back

more statistically correct
major flaw of producing much later trend change signals

usually not used (averages usually placed at end)
this technique is used almost exclusively by cyclic analysts to isolate underlying market cycles
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ties to cycles

time cycles
	play an important role in market movements (many believe)
	are used to determine the approximate times when market tops or bottoms will occur (since cycles are repetitive and can be measured)

many different cycles from 5 day to 54 year (kondratieff) exist simultaneously
there seems to be a relationship between underlying cycles that affect a certain market and correct moving averages to use
moving averages can be adjusted to fit the dominant cycles in each market

there appears to be a definite relationship between moving averages and cycles
example
	monthly cycle operates heavily in commodity markets
	cycles (tend to) relate to next longer & shorter cycles harmonically or by a factor of two
	
	a month:		20-21 trading days
	next longer  cycle:	double the length
	next shorter cycle:	half   the length
	
	might explain popularity of 5 10 20 40 day averages
	
	20 day cycle		measures monthly cycle
	40 day average		double the 20 day
	10 day average		half    of 20 
	5  day average 		half    of 10

cyclic influences & harmonic relationships of neighboring cycles can explain many commonly used moving averages (including 4-9-18 day, which are derivatives of 5, 10, 20) 
4 week cycle might explain the success of 4 week rule (and 2 week rule)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fibonacci numbers as moving averages

fib number series (13, 21, 34, 55, ...) seem to lend themselves quite well to moving average analysis

true for daily & weekly charts

21 day  average is a fib number
13 week average is a fib number (and has proven valuable in both stocks and commodities)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
applied to long term charts

proven to be useful in longer range trend analysis

10 13 30 40 week	have long been used in stock market (but not so much in futures)
10 and 40   week	used to help track primary trend (futures & stocks)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
some pros and cons of moving average

pro
	so popular as trend-following systems
	they embody some of the oldest maxims of successful trading "let profits run, while cutting losses short."
	they trade in direction of trend
	they force user to obey the rules by providing specific buy/sell signals based on principles
	they work best when market is in trending phase (due to being trend-following in nature)
	they can't be beat in (certain) trending markets (just switch to automatic)
con
	not very helpful during trendless phase (oscillators perform better in trendless phase)
	they perform very poorly when market gets choppy and trade sideways for a period of time (and that might be a third to half the time)
	dangerous to rely too heavily on them (since do not work (that well) most of the time ↑)
	a nontrending methods like over-bought/sold oscillator is more appropriate in nontrending market

adx indicator tells
	when market is trending and when is not
	whether market climate favors a trending moving average technique or a nontrending oscillator approach
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
moving averages as oscillators

construct an oscillator
	compare difference between two moving averages (results in crossover technique to take on greater significance and become even more useful)
macd
	compares two exponentially smoothed averages
	is used partially as an oscillator
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
moving average applied to other technical data

moving average can be
	applied to virtually any technical data or indicator
	used on open interest and volume figures (including on balance volume)
	used on various indicators and ratios
	applied to oscillators as well
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
optimization

goal is to find best combination of moving averages & channel breakout parameters for each market
instead of same moving average in all markets, find the one or a combination, that has worked best in past for that market
can be done for daily/weekly breakout systems & all indicators
allows technical parameters to adapt to changing market conditions
isn't the holy grail some think is (based on evidence)

correct way to optimize data (helps with closer to reality results)
	use only    part of data to  choose best parameters
	use another part of data to  test the results

should you optimize advise:
	do	 if following a handful      of markets
	don't	 if following a large number of markets (use same parameters for all)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
summary

most technicians use two sma
ema while popular no evidence proves it's better than sma

common daily averages in futures market
	4   &  9
	9   &  18
	5   &  10
	10  &  40

common in stock market
	5O day (or 10 week)
	30, 40 (or 200 days) for longer range


bollinger bands:	20 day & 20 week
useful:			20 week | 100 day
daily/weekly/monthly channel breakout works in trending market
