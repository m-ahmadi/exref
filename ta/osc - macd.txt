moving average convergence/divergence (macd)

an oscillator that uses 2 exponential moving averages
developed by gerald appel
very useful because it combines oscillator principles with dual moving average crossover approach
plots 2 lines but 3 lines are used in calculation
	faster line: (macd   line)	difference between 2 exponentially smoothed moving averages of closing prices of a period (usually last 12 and 26 days or weeks)
	slower line: (signal line)	9 period (usually) exponentially smoothed average of macd line

author recommended different numbers for buy and sell signals, but many use default values of 12 26 9 everywhere (whether daily or weekly)



generates signals when 2 lines cross
	buy:	macd line crossing  above  signal line
	sell:	...		    below  ...

macd resembles both a dual moving average crossover and an oscillator since its values fluctuate above and below a zero line

overbought:	lines are too far above zero line
oversold:	...		  below ...		(best buy signals: prices well below zero line)

another way to generate buy/sell signals:
	cross above and below zero (similar to momentum)

divergence between trend of macd lines and trend of price
	negative divergence: (bearish)		macd lines are well above zero and start to weaken while price continues to trend higher	(warning of market top)
	positive divergence: (bullish)		...		    below ...		    move up ahead of price				(often, early sign of market bottom)
	
	draw trendlines on macd lines to identify important trend changes

macd histogram

plots vertical bars that show difference between 2 macd lines (already covered: histogram of difference between 2 moving average lines)
has a zero line of its own
histogram above zero:				macd lines are in positive alignment (faster line over the slower)
histogram crossing above and below zero:	coincide with macd crossover buy/sell signals

histogram's real value:	spot when spread between 2 lines is widening or narrowing

uptrend   weakening:				histogram above zero (positive) and starts to fall toward zero
downtrend weakening (losing momentum):		...	  below ...  (negative) ...	      rise ...		(move upward)

histogram turns
	early warning that current trend is losing momentum (no actual signal until crossing zero)
	turns back toward zero always precede actual crossover signals
	best used for spotting early exit signals from existing positions
	dangerous to use them against existing trend
