gann lines are trendlines drawn from important tops/bottoms at specific geometric angles.

the most important gann line is drawn at a 45 degree angle from a peak or trough.
steeper gann lines can be drawn during an uptrend at 63 3/4 degree and 75 degree angles.
flatter gann lines can be drawn at 26 1/4 and 15 degree lines.
it's possible to draw as many as nine different gann lines.

gann lines are named after the legendary commodity trader w.d. gann.

usage
gann lines are used in the same way as speed resistance lines.

when one line is broken, prices will usually fall to the next lower line.

controversy
even if one of them works, you can't be sure in advance which one it will be.
some question the validity of drawing geometric trendlines at all.
