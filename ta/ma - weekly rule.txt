weekly rule

aka weekly price channel (developed by richard donchian)
most successful alternative trend-following device to the moving average
has many benefits of moving average but less time consuming and simpler to use
works quite well and have stood test of time
gets overlooked due to existence of fancier things
(technical trading systems development timeline: sma, doubl/triple crossover, lwma/esma)
general rule: trend-following systems dont work well in trendless phases

history
louis lukac suggest breakout (channel) systems show superior results (like weekly rule)
	12 systems tested from 1975-84
	4 generated significant profits (2 channel breakout, 1 dual crossover avg)
	
	23 systems tested from 1976-86
	extensive study done on data from 1976-86
	again channel breakout & moving average won
	
	channel breakout is great choice as a starting point system (says lokac)

4 week rule
is a simple breakout system
used primarily for futures
tends to trade less frequently (lower commission)
main criticism: does not catch tops or bottoms (same for all trend-following approaches)

info:
logic is based on sound technical principles
mechanical and clearcut signals
almost guarantees participation on right side of every important trend (due to being trend-following)
structured to follow maxim of successful trading "let profits run, while cutting losses short."
at least as good as most other trend-following systems and better than many

continuous (always in position, long or short)
	buy	when price exceeds      highs of past 4 full calendar weeks (buy long       & cover short)
	sell	when price falls below  lows  of past 4 full calendar weeks (liquidate long & sell  short)
	
	basic weakness: stays in market and get "whipsawed" during trendless periods

noncontinuous (shorter time span for sell, 1 or 2 week)			modifications 1 or 2 week for liquidation
	buy	...
	sell	... past 2 full calendar weeks

	remains out of market until a new 4 week breakout is registered

adjustments
	does not have to be a trading system
	using weekly signals as indicator to identify breakouts & trend reversals
	using weekly breakouts as confirming filter for moving average crossover (or other techniques)
	confirmed crossover signal:	2 week breakout in same direction
	excellent filters:		1 or 2 week rules
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
time period adjustment

expand or compress for risk management & sensitivity

shorter period:		more sensitive system. eg:2 week for entry (good when prices trending sharply higher, aka high priced market)

trainling stop
	long position on 4 week upside breakout		stoploss at low of past 2 weeks
	if market sharp rally				stoploss at low of past   week

8 week period		prevents position on shorter term & premature signals. iow: staying out until more important signal (eg in trading range situation)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ties to cycles

4 week (or 20 day) trading cycle is a dominant cycle that influences all markets (may explain success of 4 week period)

remember that
	variations of 4 week rule were 1 2 8 week rules
	principle of harmonics in cyclic analysis holds that each cycle is related to its neighboring cycles by 2 (next longer & next shorter cycles)
	how monthly cycle & harmonics explained popularity of 5 10 20 40 day averages (line 178)

same time periods hold true in weekly rules
daily numbers translated to weekly periods	 1 2 4 8 week


4 week rule adjustments seem to work best when 4 is divided or multiplied by 2 (this tactic has cycle logic behind it)
	to shorten		go from 4 to 2 week
	... even more		go from 2 to 1 week
	
	to lengthen		go from 4 to 8

(in charting software: plot price channels above and below current prices to spot channel breakouts)
