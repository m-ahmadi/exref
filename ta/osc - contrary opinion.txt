principle of contrary opinion in futures

oscillator analysis:	study of market extremes
contrary opinion:
	a theory in measuring those extremes (widely followed)
	a form of psychological analysis (though generally listed under category of technical analysis)
	adds the important 3rd dimension to market analysis (along fundamental & technical)
	determines degree of bullishness/bearishness among market participants

principle:	when majority of people agree on anything, they are generally wrong

first determine what majority are doing, then act in opposite direction

dean of contrary thinking:	humphrey neill (his 1954 book: "the art of contrary thinking")

what james sibbet did in 1964: (10 years after neill's book)
	applied neill's principles by creating "bullish consensus" numbers
	took a poll each week to determine degree of bull/bear among market professionals
	purpose of the poll:	quantify market sentiment into numbers
	rationale behind it:
		most traders are influenced by market advisory services
		get estimate of trader attitudes by monitoring views of professional advisors

"bullish consensus numbers"
	a service called "Consensus Index of Bullish Market Opinion" that provides an indication of market sentiment (published weekly)
	uses 75% as overbought and 25% as oversold measurement

==================================================
interpreting bullish consensus numbers

simple method used by most traders:
	above 75%	overbought (a top    may be near)
	below 25%	oversold   (a bottom may be near)

==================================================
contrary opinion measures remaining buying or selling power

example:
	1.  trader reads a forecast and thinks market is about to go higher
	2.  the more bullish the forecast, more money he puts into market
	3.  then he has no more money to buy (he is overbought)
	4.  so if 80-90% of traders are bullish on a market, it's assumed they already have taken positions
	5.  then who is left to buy and push the market higher?
	
	this a key to understanding "contrary opinion"

if major sentiment of traders is on one side of market
	not enough (buy/sell) pressure is left to continue the present trend

(if most traders think market is going higher, they have bought, so no one is left to buy anymore and push market higher)
==================================================
contrary opinion measures strong versus weak hands

1. if 80% of traders are long on a market
2. then remaining 20% shorts must be so strong to absorb longs held by other 80%
3. so the shorts must be holding much larger positions
this means
	strong hands:	20% shorts (well capitalized)
	weaker hands:	80% longs with smaller positions per trader (forced to liquidate on sudden turn)
==================================================
some additional features of bullish consensus numbers

some points on using these numbers:
	90%		upper extreme
	55%		norm or equilibrium (allows for built-in bullish bias from general public)
	20%		lower extreme
	
	(numbers are shifted upward to allow bullish bias)
	
	warning:	above 75% or under 25%
	signal:		above 90% or below 20%
	
	best to wait for change in trend of the numbers before going against the trend
	a change in direction of numbers, especially from danger zones should be watched closely	
==================================================
the importance of open interest (futures)

"open interest" plays a role in the use of "bullish consensus numbers"
	more open interest means better chance of a profitable contrarian position
	don't take contrarian position while open interest is still increasing
	continued rise in open interest increases the odds that present trend will continue
	wait for open interest to begin to flatten out or decline before taking action
	
	ensure that hedgers hold less than 50% of the open interest
	contrary opinion works better when most of open interest is held by speculators (who considered to be weaker hands)
	it's not advisable to trade against large hedging interests
==================================================
watch the market's reaction to fundamental news


watch reaction to fundamental news very closely

in overbought area
	failure to react to bullish news:	clear warning that a turn may be near
	first bad news:				enough to push prices lower
	
in oversold area (under 25%)
	failure to react to bearish news:	warning that all bad news have been ignored in the current low price
	any bullish news:			enough to push prices higher
==================================================
combine contrarian opinion with other technical tools

trade in direction of trend of "consensus numbers" until an extreme is reached
when exterem reached: monitor the numbers for a sign of a change in trend

use standard technical tools to identify market turns at these critical times
	breake of support/resistance/trendlines/moving averages can help to confirm that trend is turning
	oscillator divergences are very useful when "bullish consensus numbers" are overbought/oversold

investor sentiment readings

some polls to estimate degree of bullishness/bearishness in stock market

remember that these numbers are contrary indicators
	too much bullishness:	bad
	too much bearishness:	good

example of 4 different polls:

"investor's intelligence"	bulls: 48%		bears: 27%	correction: 24%
"aaii index" 			bullish: 53% 		bearish: 13	neutral: 34
"consensus index"		bullish opinion: 77%
"market vane" bullish 		consensus: 66%
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"investors intelligence" numbers

a weekly poll of investment advisors that produces 3 numbers: (published by "investors intelligence" company)
	bullish		n%
	bearish		n%
	correction	n% (those expecting a correction)

readings:
	bullish above 55%:	too much optimism  and potentially negative for market
	bullish below 35%:	too much pessimism and             positive for market
	correction:		represents those who are bullish but expect short term weakness

number of stocks above 10 and 30 week moving averages can also be used in contrary fashion:
	above 70%:	suggest overbought market
	below 30%:	suggest oversold   market
	
	10 week:	useful for measuring short to intermediate market turns
	30 week:	useful for measuring major market turns
	
	signal of potential trend change:	when numbers rise back above 30 or fall back below 70
