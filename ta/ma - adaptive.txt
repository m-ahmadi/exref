adaptive moving average

developed by perry kaufman (his book: "smarter trading")

problem of choosing fast or slow average?
	fast average 	gets whipsawed more   when trendless
	slow average	trails too far behind when trending
	(one might work when trending, other one while trendless)

ama automatically adjusts to the speed most suitable for market (using efficiency ratio)
speed of ama automatically adjusts to the level of noise (volatility) in market
	moves slowly when trendless
	moves faster when trending

efficiency ratio
	used in ama formula
	compares price direction & volatility level
	
	when high:	faster average (more direction  than volatility)
	when low:	slower average (more volatility than direction)
