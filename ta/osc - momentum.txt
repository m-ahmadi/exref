measuring momentum

most basic application of oscillator

momentum
	measures velocity of price changes as opposed to actual price levels
	measured by continually taking price differences for a fixed time interval

construct 10 day momentum line:
	subtract the closing price 10 days ago from last closing price
	then plot the value (positive/negative) around a zero line

formula: M = V - Vx 
	V  = latest closing price
	Vx = closing price x days ago

positive:	price is above 10 days ago (price moved higher)
negative:	price is below 10 days ago (price declined)


any time period can be used (10 day very common)
	shorter period (5 day):		more sensitive line with more pronounced oscillations
	longer  period (40 day):	much smoother  line with less volatile   oscillator swings

momentum measures rates of ascent or descent

momentum
	studies rates of ascent or descent (plots price differences of a time period)
	measures differences between prices at 2 time intervals
	measures acceleration/deceleration in current advance/decline of trend

when momentum line:
	above zero & rising + rising price:		uptrend is accelerating
	above zero & begins to come near zero:		while price may still advancing, velocity has leveled off (price same as 10 days ago)
	begins to drop toward zero:			uptrend is losing momentum (uptrend still in force but at decelerating rate)
	moves below zero:				near term downtrend in effect (price lower than 10 days ago, 10 day moving average begins to decline)
	continues dropping lower:			downtrend gains momentum
	begins to go up again:				downtrend is decelerating

when momentum line:
	advance:	price > 10 days ago
	is flat:	price = 10 days ago
	decline:	price < 10 days ago (even though price still rising)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
momentum line leads the price action

momentum line
	is always ahead of price advance/decline (due to how it's constructed)
	then levels off while current trend still in effect
	then begins to move in opposite direction as price begins to level off

*leveloff: stops rising/falling and stays at same level
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
crossing of zero line as trading signal

remember: basic trend analysis overrules (don't trade against current trend)

buy signal:	crossing above zero (only if trend is up)
sell signal:	crossing below zero (only if trend is down)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the need for upper and lower boundary

problem with momentum line:	absence of a fixed upper & lower boundary (where is considered too high/low)
solution:			draw horizontal line along previous upper/lower boundaries (line must be adjusted periodically, especially after important trend changes)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rate of change (roc)

rate of change = ratio of last price to the price of n days ago

10 day rate of change = (price / 10 days ago's price)

formula: rate of change = 100 (V / Vx)
	V:  latest close
	Vx: closing price x days ago

with this formula, the 100 line is midpoint
	price > 10 days ago:	roc above 100
	price < 10 days ago:	roc below 100

momentum & roc formulas might slightly differ in some softwares, but interpretation remains the same
