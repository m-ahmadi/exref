fibonacci extensions (aka projection, expansion) are used to
	estimate how much price may go up again after a correction
	determine profit targets

extension levels are
	possible areas where price may reverse.
	based on fibonacci ratios.

requires 3 points
	point 1:	start of a move
	point 2:	end of a move
	point 3:	end of retracement (against the move)

fibonacci extensions vs retracements
	extensions	show where price will go following a retracement (measure of impulse waves in direction of trend)
	retracements	indicate how deep a retracement could be         (measure of pullbacks within a trend)
