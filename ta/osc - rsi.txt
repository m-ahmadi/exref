relative strength index (rsi)

developed by j welles wilder (his 1978 book: "new concepts in technical trading systems")

2 major problems of momentum (price differences):
1:
	erratic movement caused by sharp changes in the values being dropped off
	a sharp advance/decline 10 days ago (in 10day mtm) can cause sudden shift in momentum line even if current prices show little change
	solution: some smoothing to minimize the distortions
2:
	lack of a constant range for comparison purposes



relative strength:
	is an inaccurate/misleading name (confuses those more familiar with how it's used in stock market analysis)
	generally means a ratio line comparing two different entities (eg: ratio of a stock to an s&p 500 index, relative strength of one thing against some other thing)
	relative strength (ratio analysis) can be very useful, but rsi is not that
	rsi does not measure relative strength between entities

rsi
	has smoothing and solves problem of erratic movement
	has a constant vertical range of O to 100


formula:
	rsi = 100 - ( 100 / (1 + rs) )
	rs = (average of x days' up closes) / (average of x days' down closes)
	
	rs:		up average / down average
	up average:	sum(total points gained on up   days during the 14 days) / 14
	down average:	sum(total points lost   on down days during the 14 days) / 14
	
	
	
14 day is common (14 week for weekly charts)
number of days is variable (wilder originally used 14 day)

rsi works best when its fluctuations reach upper/lower extremes

time period
	shorter:	more sensitive oscillator with wider    amplitude (more pronounced oscillator swings)
	longer:		smoother       oscillator with narrower amplitude

	most common: 	14 and 9 (amplitude of 9 > 14)
	other periods:
		5  or 7  day (increased volatility)
		21 or 28 day (smoothed out signals)

interpreting rsi

rsi is plotted on a vertical scale of o to 100
	movements above 70	considered overbought
	movements under 30	considered oversold

because of shifting that happens in bull & bear markets
	80 level		overbought level in bull market
	20 level		oversold   level in bear market


"failure swings" (as called by wilder)
	occur when rsi is above 70 or under 30 (must)
	top    failure swing:	rsi (over 70) in uptrend   and fails to exceed a previous high, followed by a downside break of a previous low
	bottom failure swing:	rsi (nder 30) in downtrend and fails to set    a new      low,  followed by a upside   break of a previous high

trendlines and moving averages can be used to detect changes in rsi's trend

"the single most indicative characteristic of rsi" (says wilder himself)
	divergence between rsi and price when rsi is above 70 or below 30

"greatest value of rsi" (says john murphy)
	failure swings or divergences    when rsi is above 70 or below 30

important point about oscillator usage:
	any strong trend (up or down) usually produces an extreme oscillator reading before too long
	when that happens, claiming that market is overbought/oversold is usually premature (leads to early enter/exit from a lossful/profitable trend)
	in strong uptrends, overbought markets can stay overbought for some time
	just because oscillator moves into upper region is not enough reason to liquidate a long position (or even worse short into the strong uptrend)
	
	first move  into overbought/oversold region is usually just a   warning
	second move into the danger zone            is a more important signal
	if second move fails to confirm the price move into new highs/lows, a possible divergence exists (forming a double top/bottom on the oscillator)
	at this point, some defensive action can be taken to protect existing positions
	if oscillator moves in opposite direction, breaking a previous high/low, then a divergence or failure swing is confirmed

	50 level is rsi midpoint value, and often acts as support during pullbacks and resistance during bounces
	some traders treat crossings above/below the 50 level as buy/sell signal

using 70 and 30 lines to generate signals

traders often use 70/30 lines to generate buy/sell signals


oversold warning:	oscillator dips under 30
getting stronger:	some type of divergence or double bottom develops in oscillator (under 30)
buy signal:		a crossing back above 30 (confirms that trend in oscillator has turned up)

...
...
sell signal:		a crossing back under 70
