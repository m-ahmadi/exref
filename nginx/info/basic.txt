nginx has one master process and several worker processes.
the main purpose of the master process is to read and evaluate configuration, and maintain worker processes.
worker processes do actual processing of requests.

nginx employs event-based model and OS-dependent mechanisms to
efficiently distribute requests among worker processes.

the number of worker processes is defined in the configuration file and
may be fixed for a given configuration or automatically adjusted to the number of available CPU cores.

The way nginx and its modules work is determined in the configuration file.
By default, the configuration file is named nginx.conf and placed in the directory /usr/local/nginx/conf, /etc/nginx, or /usr/local/etc/nginx.
