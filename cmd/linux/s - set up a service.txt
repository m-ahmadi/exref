1. create script file
	/usr/local/bin/app.js
	
	first line must be:
		#!/usr/bin/env node
	make sure file does not have \r\n line-endings, or you'll see
	"/usr/bin/env: ‘node\r’: No such file or directory" error


2. make script file executable
	sudo chmod +x app.js			set file as executable
	
	optional:
		sudo chmod 744 app.js
	which allow "read,write,execute" for "owner", and "read" for "group,other"


3. create service config file
	/etc/systemd/system/myapp.service
	(look in .\systemd.service file for syntax examples)
	
	if file is not directly in /etc/systemd/system/
	then must first run:
		sudo systemctl enable /absolute/path/to/myapp.service
	which creates a symlink in the orig path
	
	optional:
		sudo chmod 664 /path/to/myapp.service
		sudo chmod 644 ...
	which allows "read,write" for "user,group", and "read" for "other"


4. enable service to run on boot, start it, and see its status and full logs
	sudo systemctl daemon-reload		read latest .service file (not necessary the first time)
	sudo systemctl enable myapp		enable run on boot
	sudo systemctl start myapp		start service
	sudo systemctl status myapp		see status after start
	journalctl -u myapp			see full logs

done.

--------------------------------------------------
note

after modifying the `app.js`, must run:
	sudo systemctl restart myapp

after modifying the `myapp.service` file, must run:
	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	sudo systemctl start myapp
--------------------------------------------------
system vs user service

system service:
	config:	/etc/systemd/system/myapp.service
		WantedBy=multi-user.target
	script:	/usr/local/bin/app.js
	cmds:	no --user after command, with sudo for systemctl
		sudo systemctl ... myapp
		jouranlctrl -u myapp ...
user service:
	config:	~/.config/systemd/user/myapp.service
		WantedBy=default.target
	script:	~/myapp/app.js (must be somewhere under ~/)
	cmds:	--user after command, no sudo
		systemctl --user ... myapp
		journalctl --user -u myapp ...
	
	note:	user services only run when user session is active
		run at boot (without login):
			loginctl enable-linger $USER
		undo:
			loginctl disable-linger $USER
		check:
			loginctl show-user $USER | grep Linger
--------------------------------------------------
delete service

systemctl stop myapp				stop the service (if running)
systemctl disable myapp				disable the service (removes from auto-start)
rm -f /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service		delete service config
systemctl daemon-reload				reload systemd

systemctl list-unit-files | grep autop	check: must show nothing
--------------------------------------------------
