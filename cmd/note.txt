filename patterns:
WORD		refers to a cli
WORD - WORD	refers to a solution for a problem
		if 1st WORD refers to a cli, then refers to another page for that cli

for example:
ark	architectural
file	filesystem
net	netowrk
sys	system
sol	generic solutions that do not belong to a specific category

note that, "foo - bar" essentially means "sol - foo - bar", but "sol" is omitted for the sake of briefness
