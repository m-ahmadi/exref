// icon class:
'icon': 'jstree-icon jstree-file'

/* icon property:
to change the icon of the node use the icon property.
specifying a string containing a / will display that image as the node icon.
using any other string will apply that class to the <i> element that is used to represent the icon.
you can use boolean false to make jsTree render the node with no icon. */
