this simply does not work and you would get an "MISMATCHED ANONYMOUS DEFINE() MODULES" error,

as many 3rd party codes use define calls for various reasons and it would mess-up requirejs.

so an all-in-one file that contains library and application code does not work with requirejs,
and you will need at least two files.
