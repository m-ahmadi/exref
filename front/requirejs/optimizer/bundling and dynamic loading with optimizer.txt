The optimizer will only combine modules that are:
	specified in arrays of string literals
	and
	passed to top-level require and define calls.

So if you want to seperate:
	modules that will get bundled together (static), and
	modules that are separate at all times (dynamic):

define static modules in top-level define calls, and
define dynamic modules in child-level require calls.
