We can create a build system in RequireJS that bundles up everything into a single file,
but the final file (you know app.js bundle.js etc),
is going to be in a format that needs RequireJS itself, what's that mean?
basically it's going to be a series of define() functions.
So I think the only way to, do what you do with browserify,
is to write a build script that takes those define functions,
and handles their names, depenencies, etc.

So the motivation for me to look into RequireJS, was,
the build system of jQuery,
which I glanced at and saw RequireJS in its package.json devdeps, and AMD define() functions,
So I thought maybe it's possible to build all of those define() functions,
into a final bundle.js, but then I realized that jQuery has a custom build script,
that takes those define() functions and handles them.

taken from: jquery-master/build/tasks/build.js
Special concat/build task to handle various jQuery build requirements

Concats AMD modules, removes their definitions, and includes/excludes specified modules.



Update:
There's another option called almond,
which comes and takes those define() functions, and loads them into a single file.
I have not tested almond yet.
