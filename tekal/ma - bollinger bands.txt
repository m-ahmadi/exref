bollinger bands

developed by john bollinger
are two trading bands placed around a moving average similar to envelopes, except they
are placed two standard deviations above & below a (usually) 20 day moving average
can also be applied to weekly/monthly charts by using 20 week/month instead of 20 day
work best when combined with overbought/oversold oscillators
bandwidth measures volatility
tend to alternate between expansion & contraction
	
standard deviation describes how prices are dispersed around an average value and using two ensures that 95% of price data falls between the two bands

prices are considered
	overextended upside   (overbought)	when prices touch upper band
	overextended downside (oversold)	when prices touch lower band

using bands as price targets
	if prices bounce off lower band and cross above 20 day average, upper band becomes target
	a crossing below 20 day average would identify the lower band as target

in a strong uptrend
	prices usually fluctuate between upper band and the average
	a crossing below the average warns of a trend reversal to the downside

major difference of bollinger bands and envelopes
	envelopes stay a constant percentage width apart
	bollinger bands expand and contract based on last 20 days' volatility

distance between the bands
	will widen 		during a period of rising price volatility
	will contract		during a period of low    price volatility

when bands are unusually far apart:		a sign (often) that current trend may be ending
when bands are too close to near each other:	a sign (often) that a new   trend may be starting
