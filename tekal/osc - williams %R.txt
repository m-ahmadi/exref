larry williams %R

based on a similar concept of measuring latest close in relation to its price range over a number of days

formula: ( (today' close) - (period' high) ) / (total range: period' high - period' low)
	looks like upside down stochastics (since %R subtracted from high) and to correct that, charting softwares plot an inverted version of %R

interpretation (same as already discussed)
	presence of divergences in overbought/oversold areas
