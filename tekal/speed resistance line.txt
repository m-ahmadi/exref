speed resistance lines (or speedlines) technique combines the trendline with percentage retracements.
it was developed by edson gould and it's an adaptation of the idea of dividing the trend into thirds.

difference from the percentage retracement
it measures the rate of ascent or descent of a trend (its speed).

construction
bullish speedline
	find the highest point in the current uptrend.
	from that high point, a vertical line is drawn downward to where the trend began.
	that vertical line is then divided into thirds.
	a trendline is drawn from start of the trend through the 2 points marked on the vertical line (one-third and two-thirds points).
bearish speedline
	reverse process of bullish.
	measure the vertical distance from the low point in the downtrend to the start of the trend.
	draw 2 lines from the start of the trend through the one-third and two-thirds points on the vertical line.

a new set of lines must be drawn each time a new high/low is set in an uptrend/downtrend.

trendlines drawn from start of the trend to the one-third and two-thirds points may move through some of the price action,
this is one case where trendlines are not drawn under lows or over highs, but actually through the price action.

implications

uptrend
downside corrections stop at the higher speedline (2/3).
if not stopped at 2/3, prices drop to the lower speedline (1/3).
if the 1/3 line is broken, prices continue all the way to the start of the prior trend.

downtrend
the breaking of the lower line (2/3) indicates a rally to the higher line (1/3).
if 1/3 line is broken, a rally to the top of the prior trend would be indicated.

role reversal

speedlines reverse roles once they are broken. (same as all trendlines)

during the correction of an uptrend:
	if the 2/3 line is broken and prices fall to the 1/3 line and rally from there, that 2/3 line becomes a resistance barrier.
	when the upper line (2/3) is broken, it signals that the old highs will be challenged.

the same principle holds true in downtrends.
