4-9-18 day moving average system

shortest average follows the trend most closely

proper alignment
	in uptrend	4 above 9 and 9 above 18
	in downtrend	4 lowest, followed by 9 and then 18 (exact opposite of uptrend)

in downtrend
	buy alert:		when 4 crosses above both 9 and 18
	confirmed buy signal:	when 9 day crosses above 18 (4 over 9, 9 over 18)
	general uptrend remains intact despite of some intermingling of averages during corrections or consolidations
	during intermingling some might buy more and some might take profit (depending on how aggressively one wants to trade)

in uptred
	sell alert:		when 4 dips below 9 and 18 (might be enough for some traders to liquidate longs, sign that uptrend reversing to the downside)
	confirmed sell signal:	when 9 drops below 18 (or sell short signal)
