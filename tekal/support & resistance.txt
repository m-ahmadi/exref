support    is a previous low
resistance is a previous high

for an uptrend to continue:
	each support    level must be higher than the one before it.
	each resistance level must be higher than the one before it.

if corrective dip in uptrend comes down to previous low:
	early warning of uptrend ending or changing to sideways trend

if previous support level is violated:
	stronger warning of trend reversal from up to down

each time a previous resistance peak is being tested, the uptrend is in an especially critical phase.

first warning that the existing trend is changing (usually):
	failing to exceed   a previous resistance (peak) in an uptrend
	ability to fall off a previous support    (low)  in a  downtrend

reversal of roles

when a support/resistance level is penetrated by a significant amount, they reverse roles.
the more trading that takes place in a support area, the more significant it becomes.
the amount of trading in a given support/resistance area can be determined in 3 ways:

the amount of time spent there
	the longer the period of time that prices trade in a support/resistance area, the more significant that area becomes.
	
volume
	a support level formed on heavy volume is more important than a one formed on low volume.
	charts of intraday trading activity are useful in identifying price levels where most trading took place.

how recently the trading took place
	the more recent the activity, the more powerful it becomes

the distance prices travel away from a support/resistance area in future
	the more distance prices travel away from a support/resistance area, the more significant that area becomes.
	(particularly true when support and resistance levels are penetrated and reverse roles)

the more significant a previous support area is, the more potent resistance area it becomes later.
all factors that created support previously, now function to put a ceiling over prices on subsequent rallies or bounces.

degree of penetration

a support level, penetrated by a significant margin, becomes a resistance level and vice versa.
support and resistance levels reverse roles only after a significant penetration.

determining whether a penetration is significant:
	a 3% penetration criteria for major        support/resistance levels (particularly)
	a 1% penetration criteria for shorter term support/resistance areas

round numbers

numbers such as 10, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100 (and multiples of 1000) are important round numbers.
round numbers tend to stop advances or declines.
round numbers often act as psychological support/resistance levels.

because others are trying to buy/cell the market at round numbers, the market may never get there, so as a general rule:
	avoid placing trading orders right at obvious round numbers.
	avoid placing protective stops     at obvious round numbers.
