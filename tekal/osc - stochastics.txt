stochastics (k%d)

developed by george lane
based on the observation that:
	in uptrend	closing price tends to be closer to upper end of price range
	in downtrend	...				    lower ...

2 lines are used in stochastic process
	%K line		more sensitive
	%D line		more important, provides major signals

goal:	where the most recent closing price is in relation to price range of a time period

most common time period is 14

%K line formula:
	%K = 100 * ( (C - L14) / (H14 - L14) )
	C:		latest close
	L14:		lowest  low  of last 14 periods (periods: days/weeks/months)
	H14:		highest high of last 14 periods ...
	
	measures on a percentage basis of 0 to 100, where closing price is in relation to price range of a selected time period


high reading (over  80):	puts closing price near the top    of the range
low  reading (under 20):	...			    bottom ...

%D line formula:
	fast stochastics:	a       3 period moving average of %K line
	slow stochastics:	another 3 period        average of %D line (smoother than the fast one)

	most traders use the slow one because of its more reliable signals
	second smoothing produces 3 lines, fast uses first 2, slow uses last 2


plots 2 lines that oscillate between a vertical scale from 0 to 100
	%K line:	faster line
	%D line:	slower line

major signal:
	divergence between %D line and price when %D line is in overbought/oversold area
	upper extreme:	80
	lower extreme:	20
	
	bearish divergence:	%D line above 80 and forms 2 declining peaks   while price continues to go higher
	bullish divergence: 	...     below 20 ...	   2 rising    bottoms ... 			   lower

	buy/sell signal:	faster %K line crosses slower %D line (assuming all prev factors are in place)


this was an essential explanation (there are other refinements in usage of stochastics)
while more sophisticated, basic oscillator interpretation remains the same
	alert:		%D line in extreme area and diverging from price action
	signal:		%D line is crossed by %K line

weekly and monthly charts can be used for longer range perspective
also effective on intraday charts for shorter term trading

one way to combine daily and weekly stochastics:
	use weekly signals to determine market direction
	use daily  signals for timing

it's also a good idea to combine stochastics with rsi
