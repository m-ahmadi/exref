constructing an oscillator using 2 moving averages

plot the difference between 2 averages as histogram
histogram bars appear as plus/minus values around a centered zero line

relationships between 2 averages can be used
	as a trend-following system
	to help identify short term overbought/oversold conditions

uses:
	helps spot divergences
	helps identify short term variations from long term trend (when shortAvg moves too far above/below longAvg)
	pinpoint crossings of 2 averages (when oscillator crosses zero)

formula:	shortAvg / longAvg

shortAvg oscillates around longAvg
oscillator is:
	positive	when	short above long
	negative	when	short below long

when 2 averages move too far apart:
	a market extreme is created, calling for a pause in trend
	trend remains paused until shortAvg moves back to longAvg (very often)

when shortAvg approaches longAvg a critical point is reached
	in uptrend:
		ideal buy:		short dips back to long AND bounces off it (much like testing of up trendline)
		trend reversal signal:	short dips back to long AND crosses below
	in downtrend:
		ideal sell:		short rises     to long
		trend reversal signal:	short rises     to long AND crosses long
