oscillator
	is an alternative to trend-following approaches
	extremely useful in trendless market (prices fluctuating in horizontal band or trading range)
	enables profiting from periodic sideways
	also useful in trending phases (in conjunction with other tools) by alerting short term extremes (overbought/oversold)
	can warn that trend is losing momentum before evident in price action
	can signal that trend is near completion by showing certain divergences
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
oscillator usage in conjunction with trend


direction of overriding trend is very important
oscillator
	is only a secondary indicator (must be secondary to basic trend analysis)
	is not that helpful near the beginning of important moves (can even be misleading)
	becomes extremely valuable toward the end of market moves
no study of market extremes is complete without discussing contrary opinion philosophy

=================================================
interpretation of oscillators
different ways to construct oscillators but interpretation differs very little

most oscillators
	plotted at bottom of chart and resemble a flat horizontal band
	highs & lows in oscillator coincide with highs & lows in chart
some oscillators
	have a midpoint value (usually zero line) that divides the range to 2 halves (upper & lower)
	have upper & lower boundaries ranging from 0 to 100

=================================================
general interpretation rules

when oscillator reaches extreme value in upper/lower ends
	current price move has gone too far too fast (due for correction/consolidation)
when oscillator line in
	lower end:	buy
	upper end:	sell
crossing of midpoint line often used to generate buy/sell signals

=================================================
3 situation when oscillator is most useful is when
	1. its value reaches an extreme reading near the upper/lower end of its boundaries (upper=overbought, lower=oversold, warns that trend is overextended/vulnerable)
	2. it's in extreme position and there's a divergence between oscillator & price action (usually an important warning)
	3. it's crossing the zero line (important signal in direction of trend)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
measuring momentum

most basic application of oscillator

momentum
	measures velocity of price changes as opposed to actual price levels
	measured by continually taking price differences for a fixed time interval

construct 10 day momentum line:
	subtract the closing price 10 days ago from last closing price
	then plot the value (positive/negative) around a zero line

formula: M = V - Vx 
	V  = latest closing price
	Vx = closing price x days ago

positive:	price is above 10 days ago (price moved higher)
negative:	price is below 10 days ago (price declined)


any time period can be used (10 day very common)
	shorter period (5 day):		more sensitive line with more pronounced oscillations
	longer  period (40 day):	much smoother  line with less volatile   oscillator swings

=================================================
momentum measures rates of ascent or descent

momentum
	studies rates of ascent or descent (plots price differences of a time period)
	measures differences between prices at 2 time intervals
	measures acceleration/deceleration in current advance/decline of trend

when momentum line:
	above zero & rising + rising price:		uptrend is accelerating
	above zero & begins to come near zero:		while price may still advancing, velocity has leveled off (price same as 10 days ago)
	begins to drop toward zero:			uptrend is losing momentum (uptrend still in force but at decelerating rate)
	moves below zero:				near term downtrend in effect (price lower than 10 days ago, 10 day moving average begins to decline)
	continues dropping lower:			downtrend gains momentum
	begins to go up again:				downtrend is decelerating

when momentum line:
	advance:	price > 10 days ago
	is flat:	price = 10 days ago
	decline:	price < 10 days ago (even though price still rising)
=================================================
momentum line leads the price action

momentum line
	is always ahead of price advance/decline (due to how it's constructed)
	then levels off while current trend still in effect
	then begins to move in opposite direction as price begins to level off

*leveloff: stops rising/falling and stays at same level
=================================================
crossing of zero line as trading signal

remember: basic trend analysis overrules (don't trade against current trend)

buy signal:	crossing above zero (only if trend is up)
sell signal:	crossing below zero (only if trend is down)
=================================================
the need for upper and lower boundary

problem with momentum line:	absence of a fixed upper & lower boundary (where is considered too high/low)
solution:			draw horizontal line along previous upper/lower boundaries (line must be adjusted periodically, especially after important trend changes)
=================================================
rate of change (roc)

rate of change = ratio of last price to the price of n days ago

10 day rate of change = (price / 10 days ago's price)

formula: rate of change = 100 (V / Vx)
	V:  latest close
	Vx: closing price x days ago

with this formula, the 100 line is midpoint
	price > 10 days ago:	roc above 100
	price < 10 days ago:	roc below 100

momentum & roc formulas might slightly differ in some softwares, but interpretation remains the same
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
constructing an oscillator using 2 moving averages

plot the difference between 2 averages as histogram
histogram bars appear as plus/minus values around a centered zero line

relationships between 2 averages can be used
	as a trend-following system
	to help identify short term overbought/oversold conditions

uses:
	helps spot divergences
	helps identify short term variations from long term trend (when shortAvg moves too far above/below longAvg)
	pinpoint crossings of 2 averages (when oscillator crosses zero)

formula:	shortAvg / longAvg

shortAvg oscillates around longAvg
oscillator is:
	positive	when	short above long
	negative	when	short below long

when 2 averages move too far apart:
	a market extreme is created, calling for a pause in trend
	trend remains paused until shortAvg moves back to longAvg (very often)

when shortAvg approaches longAvg a critical point is reached
	in uptrend:
		ideal buy:		short dips back to long AND bounces off it (much like testing of up trendline)
		trend reversal signal:	short dips back to long AND crosses below
	in downtrend:
		ideal sell:		short rises     to long
		trend reversal signal:	short rises     to long AND crosses long
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
commodity channel index

a momentum-based oscillator
it's possible to normalize an oscillator by dividing the values by a constant divisor
while:
	originally developed for commodities, also used for stock/index/futures/options
	20 days most common, it can vary to adjust sensitivity
developed by donald lambert

cci:
	compares current price with a moving average over a selected time span (usually 20 days)
	values are normalized by using a divisor based on mean deviation
	fluctuates in a constant range from +100 upside to -100 downside

buy: 	values above +100
sell: 	values below -100

cci as overbought/oversold oscillator
	above +100:	overbought
	below -100:	oversold
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
relative strength index (rsi)

developed by j welles wilder (his 1978 book: "new concepts in technical trading systems")

2 major problems of momentum (price differences):
1:
	erratic movement caused by sharp changes in the values being dropped off
	a sharp advance/decline 10 days ago (in 10day mtm) can cause sudden shift in momentum line even if current prices show little change
	solution: some smoothing to minimize the distortions
2:
	lack of a constant range for comparison purposes



relative strength:
	is an inaccurate/misleading name (confuses those more familiar with how it's used in stock market analysis)
	generally means a ratio line comparing two different entities (eg: ratio of a stock to an s&p 500 index, relative strength of one thing against some other thing)
	relative strength (ratio analysis) can be very useful, but rsi is not that
	rsi does not measure relative strength between entities

rsi
	has smoothing and solves problem of erratic movement
	has a constant vertical range of O to 100


formula:
	rsi = 100 - ( 100 / (1 + rs) )
	rs = (average of x days' up closes) / (average of x days' down closes)
	
	rs:		up average / down average
	up average:	sum(total points gained on up   days during the 14 days) / 14
	down average:	sum(total points lost   on down days during the 14 days) / 14
	
	
	
14 day is common (14 week for weekly charts)
number of days is variable (wilder originally used 14 day)

rsi works best when its fluctuations reach upper/lower extremes

time period
	shorter:	more sensitive oscillator with wider    amplitude (more pronounced oscillator swings)
	longer:		smoother       oscillator with narrower amplitude

	most common: 	14 and 9 (amplitude of 9 > 14)
	other periods:
		5  or 7  day (increased volatility)
		21 or 28 day (smoothed out signals)
=================================================
interpreting rsi

rsi is plotted on a vertical scale of o to 100
	movements above 70	considered overbought
	movements under 30	considered oversold

because of shifting that happens in bull & bear markets
	80 level		overbought level in bull market
	20 level		oversold   level in bear market


"failure swings" (as called by wilder)
	occur when rsi is above 70 or under 30 (must)
	top    failure swing:	rsi (over 70) in uptrend   and fails to exceed a previous high, followed by a downside break of a previous low
	bottom failure swing:	rsi (nder 30) in downtrend and fails to set    a new      low,  followed by a upside   break of a previous high

trendlines and moving averages can be used to detect changes in rsi's trend

"the single most indicative characteristic of rsi" (says wilder himself)
	divergence between rsi and price when rsi is above 70 or below 30

"greatest value of rsi" (says john murphy)
	failure swings or divergences    when rsi is above 70 or below 30

important point about oscillator usage:
	any strong trend (up or down) usually produces an extreme oscillator reading before too long
	when that happens, claiming that market is overbought/oversold is usually premature (leads to early enter/exit from a lossful/profitable trend)
	in strong uptrends, overbought markets can stay overbought for some time
	just because oscillator moves into upper region is not enough reason to liquidate a long position (or even worse short into the strong uptrend)
	
	first move  into overbought/oversold region is usually just a   warning
	second move into the danger zone            is a more important signal
	if second move fails to confirm the price move into new highs/lows, a possible divergence exists (forming a double top/bottom on the oscillator)
	at this point, some defensive action can be taken to protect existing positions
	if oscillator moves in opposite direction, breaking a previous high/low, then a divergence or failure swing is confirmed

	50 level is rsi midpoint value, and often acts as support during pullbacks and resistance during bounces
	some traders treat crossings above/below the 50 level as buy/sell signal
=================================================
using 70 and 30 lines to generate signals

traders often use 70/30 lines to generate buy/sell signals


oversold warning:	oscillator dips under 30
getting stronger:	some type of divergence or double bottom develops in oscillator (under 30)
buy signal:		a crossing back above 30 (confirms that trend in oscillator has turned up)

...
...
sell signal:		a crossing back under 70
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
stochastics (k%d)

developed by george lane
based on the observation that:
	in uptrend	closing price tends to be closer to upper end of price range
	in downtrend	...				    lower ...

2 lines are used in stochastic process
	%K line		more sensitive
	%D line		more important, provides major signals

goal:	where the most recent closing price is in relation to price range of a time period

most common time period is 14

%K line formula:
	%K = 100 * ( (C - L14) / (H14 - L14) )
	C:		latest close
	L14:		lowest  low  of last 14 periods (periods: days/weeks/months)
	H14:		highest high of last 14 periods ...
	
	measures on a percentage basis of 0 to 100, where closing price is in relation to price range of a selected time period


high reading (over  80):	puts closing price near the top    of the range
low  reading (under 20):	...			    bottom ...

%D line formula:
	fast stochastics:	a       3 period moving average of %K line
	slow stochastics:	another 3 period        average of %D line (smoother than the fast one)

	most traders use the slow one because of its more reliable signals
	second smoothing produces 3 lines, fast uses first 2, slow uses last 2


plots 2 lines that oscillate between a vertical scale from 0 to 100
	%K line:	faster line
	%D line:	slower line

major signal:
	divergence between %D line and price when %D line is in overbought/oversold area
	upper extreme:	80
	lower extreme	20
	
	bearish divergence:	%D line above 80 and forms 2 declining peaks   while price continues to go higher
	bullish divergence: 	...     below 20 ...	   2 rising    bottoms ... 			   lower

	buy/sell signal:	faster %K line crosses slower %D line (assuming all prev factors are in place)


this was an essential explanation (there are other refinements in usage of stochastics)
while more sophisticated, basic oscillator interpretation remains the same
	alert:		%D line in extreme area and diverging from price action
	signal:		%D line is crossed by %K line

weekly and monthly charts can be used for longer range perspective
also effective on intraday charts for shorter term trading

one way to combine daily and weekly stochastics:
	use weekly signals to determine market direction
	use daily  signals for timing

it's also a good idea to combine stochastics with rsi
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
larry williams %R

based on a similar concept of measuring latest close in relation to its price range over a number of days

formula: ( (today' close) - (period' high) ) / (total range: period' high - period' low)
	looks like upside down stochastics (since %R subtracted from high) and to correct that, charting softwares plot an inverted version of %R

interpretation (same as already discussed)
	presence of divergences in overbought/oversold areas
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
choice of time period tied to cycles

oscillator lengths can be tied to underlying market cycles

a time period of 1/2 (half) the cycle length is used

popular time inputs:		 5 10 20    days	(previous chapter discussed why 5 10 20 keep appearing in moving average and oscillator formulations)
based on calendar day periods:	   14 28 56 days

rsi uses 14 days which is half of 28

28 calendar days (20 trading days)
	important dominant monthly trading cycle (other numbers are harmonically related to it)
	popularity of following lengths are largely based on 28 day cycle and its 1/2 (half)
	popular lengths based on it and its 1/2 (half)
		10 day momentum
		14 day rsi
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
importance of trend

covered so far
	oscillator used to
		detect near term overbought/oversold conditions
		alert traders to possible divergences
	momentum
	roc using price ratios instead of differences
	moving average
	rsi
	stochastics
	oscillator synced with cycles
	oscillator's greatest value: divergence

caution
	do not place too much importance on divergence analysis to the point of ignoring basic trend analysis
	most oscillator buy  signals work best in uptrends
	...		sell signals ...	  downtrends

how should be
	start with determining general trend of market
	if trend is up, use a buying strategy
	then use oscillator for time of entry
	buy  when market is oversold   in an uptrend
	sell ...	    overbought ...   downtrend
	or
	buy  when momentum crosses back above zero line when major trend is bullish
	sell ...			under ...			    bearish
	
always trade in direction of the major trend

danger of placing too much importance on oscillator:
	temptation to use divergence as excuse to trade against the general trend (costly and painful)

oscillator must be used as aid for basic trend analysis (and not a substitute)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when oscillators are most useful

some times oscillators are more useful than other times

oscillators track price very closely during choppy market periods (sideways for several weeks/months)
price and oscillator look very much alike because both are moving sideways (highs & lows of price coincide almost exactly with highs & lows on oscillator)
at some point a breakout happens and a new trend begins (up/down)
when breakout happens, oscillator is already in extreme position (by its very nature)
in upside   breakout, oscillator is already overbought
.. downside ...       oscillator ...	    oversold
trader dilemma:
	should I buy  bullish breakout while oscillator in overbought reading?
	...    I sell bearish ...			   oversold   ...    ?

it's best to ignore the oscillator for the time being and the position taken
why?
	in early stages of a new trend, after an important breakout
	oscillators often reach extremes very quickly and stay there for awhile
	oscillators must be given a lesser role and basic trend analysis should be used at such times
	oscillators gain back greater weight later on as trend begins to mature
	(5th elliott wave is often confirmed by bearish oscillator divergences)


many dynamic bull moves are missed by traders who saw the major trend signal, but decided to wait for oscillators to move into oversold before buying
summary
	oscillator lesser  importance in early stages of important move
	...	   greater ...		 later ... 		   ...  (when move reaches maturity)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
moving average convergence/divergence (macd)

an oscillator that uses 2 exponential moving averages
developed by gerald appel
very useful because it combines oscillator principles with dual moving average crossover approach
plots 2 lines but 3 lines are used in calculation
	faster line: (macd   line)	difference between 2 exponentially smoothed moving averages of closing prices of a period (usually last 12 and 26 days or weeks)
	slower line: (signal line)	9 period (usually) exponentially smoothed average of macd line

author recommended different numbers for buy and sell signals, but many use default values of 12 26 9 everywhere (whether daily or weekly)



generates signals when 2 lines cross
	buy:	macd line crossing  above  signal line
	sell:	...		    below  ...

macd resembles both a dual moving average crossover and an oscillator since its values fluctuate above and below a zero line

overbought:	lines are too far above zero line
oversold:	...		  below ...		(best buy signals: prices well below zero line)

another way to generate buy/sell signals:
	cross above and below zero (similar to momentum)

divergence between trend of macd lines and trend of price
	negative divergence: (bearish)		macd lines are well above zero and start to weaken while price continues to trend higher	(warning of market top)
	positive divergence: (bullish)		...		    below ...		    move up ahead of price				(often, early sign of market bottom)
	
	draw trendlines on macd lines to identify important trend changes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
macd histogram

plots vertical bars that show difference between 2 macd lines (already covered: histogram of difference between 2 moving average lines)
has a zero line of its own
histogram above zero:				macd lines are in positive alignment (faster line over the slower)
histogram crossing above and below zero:	coincide with macd crossover buy/sell signals

histogram's real value:	spot when spread between 2 lines is widening or narrowing

uptrend   weakening:				histogram above zero (positive) and starts to fall toward zero
downtrend weakening (losing momentum):		...	  below ...  (negative) ...	      rise ...		(move upward)

histogram turns
	early warning that current trend is losing momentum (no actual signal until crossing zero)
	turns back toward zero always precede actual crossover signals
	best used for spotting early exit signals from existing positions
	dangerous to use them against existing trend
=================================================
combine weeklies and dailies

signals on weekly charts are always more important than on daily charts (for all indicators)

best way to combine:
	use weekly signals to determine market direction
	use daily  signals to fine-tune entry/exit points

a daily signal is followed only when it agrees with the weekly signal
	weekly signals become trend filters for daily signals
	prevents using daily signals to against existing trend
	this principle is especially true in macd & stochastics (which both are crossover systems)
