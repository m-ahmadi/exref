oscillator
	is an alternative to trend-following approaches
	extremely useful in trendless market (prices fluctuating in horizontal band or trading range)
	enables profiting from periodic sideways
	also useful in trending phases (in conjunction with other tools) by alerting short term extremes (overbought/oversold)
	can warn that trend is losing momentum before evident in price action
	can signal that trend is near completion by showing certain divergences
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
oscillator usage in conjunction with trend

direction of overriding trend is very important
oscillator
	is only a secondary indicator (must be secondary to basic trend analysis)
	is not that helpful near the beginning of important moves (can even be misleading)
	becomes extremely valuable toward the end of market moves
no study of market extremes is complete without discussing contrary opinion philosophy

=================================================
interpretation of oscillators
different ways to construct oscillators but interpretation differs very little

most oscillators
	plotted at bottom of chart and resemble a flat horizontal band
	highs & lows in oscillator coincide with highs & lows in chart
some oscillators
	have a midpoint value (usually zero line) that divides the range to 2 halves (upper & lower)
	have upper & lower boundaries ranging from 0 to 100

=================================================
general interpretation rules

when oscillator reaches extreme value in upper/lower ends
	current price move has gone too far too fast (due for correction/consolidation)
when oscillator line in
	lower end:	buy
	upper end:	sell
crossing of midpoint line often used to generate buy/sell signals

=================================================
3 situation when oscillator is most useful is when
	1. its value reaches an extreme reading near the upper/lower end of its boundaries (upper=overbought, lower=oversold, warns that trend is overextended/vulnerable)
	2. it's in extreme position and there's a divergence between oscillator & price action (usually an important warning)
	3. it's crossing the zero line (important signal in direction of trend)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
choice of time period tied to cycles

oscillator lengths can be tied to underlying market cycles

a time period of 1/2 (half) the cycle length is used

popular time inputs:		 5 10 20    days	(previous chapter discussed why 5 10 20 keep appearing in moving average and oscillator formulations)
based on calendar day periods:	   14 28 56 days

rsi uses 14 days which is half of 28

28 calendar days (20 trading days)
	important dominant monthly trading cycle (other numbers are harmonically related to it)
	popularity of following lengths are largely based on 28 day cycle and its 1/2 (half)
	popular lengths based on it and its 1/2 (half)
		10 day momentum
		14 day rsi

importance of trend

covered so far
	oscillator used to
		detect near term overbought/oversold conditions
		alert traders to possible divergences
	momentum
	roc using price ratios instead of differences
	moving average
	rsi
	stochastics
	oscillator synced with cycles
	oscillator's greatest value: divergence

caution
	do not place too much importance on divergence analysis to the point of ignoring basic trend analysis
	most oscillator buy  signals work best in uptrends
	...		sell signals ...	  downtrends

how should be
	start with determining general trend of market
	if trend is up, use a buying strategy
	then use oscillator for time of entry
	buy  when market is oversold   in an uptrend
	sell ...	    overbought ...   downtrend
	or
	buy  when momentum crosses back above zero line when major trend is bullish
	sell ...			under ...			    bearish
	
always trade in direction of the major trend

danger of placing too much importance on oscillator:
	temptation to use divergence as excuse to trade against the general trend (costly and painful)

oscillator must be used as aid for basic trend analysis (and not a substitute)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when oscillators are most useful

some times oscillators are more useful than other times

oscillators track price very closely during choppy market periods (sideways for several weeks/months)
price and oscillator look very much alike because both are moving sideways (highs & lows of price coincide almost exactly with highs & lows on oscillator)
at some point a breakout happens and a new trend begins (up/down)
when breakout happens, oscillator is already in extreme position (by its very nature)
in upside   breakout, oscillator is already overbought
.. downside ...       oscillator ...	    oversold
trader dilemma:
	should I buy  bullish breakout while oscillator in overbought reading?
	...    I sell bearish ...			   oversold   ...    ?

it's best to ignore the oscillator for the time being and the position taken
why?
	in early stages of a new trend, after an important breakout
	oscillators often reach extremes very quickly and stay there for awhile
	oscillators must be given a lesser role and basic trend analysis should be used at such times
	oscillators gain back greater weight later on as trend begins to mature
	(5th elliott wave is often confirmed by bearish oscillator divergences)


many dynamic bull moves are missed by traders who saw the major trend signal, but decided to wait for oscillators to move into oversold before buying
summary
	oscillator lesser  importance in early stages of important move
	...	   greater ...		 later ... 		   ...  (when move reaches maturity)

combine weeklies and dailies

signals on weekly charts are always more important than on daily charts (for all indicators)

best way to combine:
	use weekly signals to determine market direction
	use daily  signals to fine-tune entry/exit points

a daily signal is followed only when it agrees with the weekly signal
	weekly signals become trend filters for daily signals
	prevents using daily signals to against existing trend
	this principle is especially true in macd & stochastics (which both are crossover systems)
