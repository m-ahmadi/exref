/*
	Here’s why:
	
	The fundamental issue here is that JavaScript (ECMAScript) is a loosely typed language
	and it performs automatic type conversion on values to accommodate the operation being performed.
	Let’s see how this plays out with each of the above examples.

	Example 1:  1 + "2" + "2"
	Outputs:    "122"
	Explanation:
	The first operation to be performed in 1 + "2".
	Since one of the operands ("2") is a string,
	JavaScript assumes it needs to perform string concatenation and therefore converts the type of 1 to "1", 1 + "2" yields "12".
	Then, "12" + "2" yields "122".

	Example 2: 1 + +"2" + "2"
	Outputs: "32"
	Explanation:
	Based on order of operations,
	the first operation to be performed is +"2" (the extra + before the first "2" is treated as a unary operator).
	Thus, JavaScript converts the type of "2" to numeric and then applies the unary + sign to it
	(i.e., treats it as a positive number).
	As a result, the next operation is now 1 + 2 which of course yields 3.
	But then, we have an operation between a number and a string (i.e., 3 and "2"),
	so once again JavaScript converts the type of the numeric value to a string and performs string concatenation,
	yielding "32".

	Example 3: 1 + -"1" + "2"
	Outputs: "02"
	Explanation:
	The explanation here is identical to the prior example,
	except the unary operator is - rather than +. So "1" becomes 1,
	which then becomes -1 when the - is applied,
	which is then added to 1 yielding 0,
	which is then converted to a string and concatenated with the final "2" operand,
	yielding "02".

	Example 4: +"1" + "1" + "2"
	Outputs: "112"
	Explanation:
	Although the first "1" operand is typecast to a numeric value based on the unary + operator that precedes it,
	it is then immediately converted back to a string when it is concatenated with the second "1" operand,
	which is then concatenated with the final "2" operand,
	yielding the string "112".

	Example 5: "A" - "B" + "2"
	Outputs: "NaN2"
	Explanation:
	Since the - operator can not be applied to strings,
	and since neither "A" nor "B" can be converted to numeric values,
	"A" - "B" yields NaN which is then concatenated with the string "2" to yield “NaN2”.

	Example 6: "A" - "B" + 2
	Outputs: NaN
	Explanation:
	As exlained in the previous example,
	"A" - "B" yields NaN.
	But any operator applied to NaN with any other numeric operand will still yield NaN.
