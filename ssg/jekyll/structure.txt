_config.yml	Configuration data. Many available from cli.
_drafts		Drafts are unpublished posts. The format of these files is without a date: title.MARKUP.
_includes	Partials to be mixed and matched by your layouts and posts. Liquid tag: {% include file.ext %} includes the partial in _includes/file.ext)
_layouts	Templates that wrap posts. Layouts are chosen on a post-by-post basis in the front matter. Liquid tag {{ content }} injects content into the web page.
_sass		Partials that can be imported into main.scss which then is processed into a single stylesheet: main.css that defines the styles to be used by your site.
_site		This is where the generated site will be placed (by default) once Jekyll is done transforming it. Add this to your .gitignore file.

_posts
	Your dynamic content.
	The naming convention of these files is important, and must follow the format: YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP.
	The permalinks can be customized for each post, but the date and markup language are determined solely by the file name.

_data	
	Well-formatted site data should be placed here.
	The Jekyll engine will autoload all data files (using either the .yml,  .yaml, .json, .csv or .tsv formats and extensions) in this directory,
	and they will be accessible via `site.data`.
	If there's a file  members.yml under the directory, then you can access contents of the file through site.data.members.

.jekyll-metadata
	This helps Jekyll keep track of which files have not been modified since the site was last built,
	and which files will need to be regenerated on the next build.
	This file will not be included in the generated site.
	It’s probably a good idea to add this to your .gitignore file.

index.html / index.md / other HTML, Markdown files
	Provided that the file has a front matter section, it will be transformed by Jekyll.
	The same will happen for any .html, .markdown, .md, or .textile file in your site’s root directory or directories not listed above.

Other Files/Folders
	Every other directory and file except for those listed above, will be copied verbatim to the generated site. (css, images folders, favicon.ico)
