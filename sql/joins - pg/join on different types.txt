if you try to join on columns of differing types you get errors like:
	JOIN/USING types numeric and character varying cannot be matched (USING clause)
	operator does not exist: character varying = numeric (ON clause)

so the types of the columns should be the same (tested and worked)

or you can cast one of them to match the other (tested and worked)
	ON (zip = ytd_sales::varchar)
