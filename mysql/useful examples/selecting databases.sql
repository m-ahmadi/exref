/*
	The USE statement selects a database to make it the default (current) database for a given connection to the server.
	You can issue USE statements as much as you want to switch between databases.
	Selecting a database doesn't limit you to using tables only from that database.
	While one database is the default, you can refer to tables in other databases,
	by qualifying their names with the appropriate database identifier.
	
	When you disconnect from the server, it doesn't hold the information about what db was the default db,
	If you connect to server again, it doesnâ€™t remember what database you had selected previously.
