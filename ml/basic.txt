a drink is wine or bear?

data gathering
	features

	data collected from glasses of wine and bear (features)
	color (nm: wavelength)
	alchohol %
	(there are many aspect of drinks that we can collect data on,
	amount of foam, shape of the glass, ...)

data preparation
	labeling
	randomize (not in time-series?)
	deduplicaiton | normalazitaion | error correction
	good time to see:
		if there's any relevent relations between variables
		is there any data imbalances:
			if we collected more data about bear, the model will be biased toward bear
	
	color (nm)	alchohol %	bear/wine
	610		5		bear
	599		13		wine
	693		14		wine

choosing a model
	linear model
	image data
	sequences: text/music
	numerical data
	text-based data

training
	y      = m     * x     + b
	output = slope * input + yIntercept
	
	weights = [ matrix ]
	biases  = [ matrix ]
