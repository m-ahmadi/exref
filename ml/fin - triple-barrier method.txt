triple-barrier method

label an observation based on first barrier touched out of 3 barriers (2 horizontal + 1 vertical)
triple-barrier method is path-dependent (takes into account the entire path)

2 horizontal barriers
	profit-taking and stoploss limits (dynamic function of estimated volatility)
	not necessarily symmetric

1 vertical barrier
	number of bars elapsed since position was taken (an expiration limit)

labeling: (if touched first)
	upper    barrier	label =  1
	lower    barrier	label = −1
	vertical barrier	label = sign of return (realizing a profit or loss within limits)  |  0


feature return = delta from X to barrier touch
