controls how quickly the model is adapted to the problem (may be the most important hyperparameter)

smaller   lr	needs more  training epochs (cuz smaller changes made to weights each update)
larger    lr	needs fewer training epochs (cuz rapid   changes ...)

too large lr	causes model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution
too small lr	cause the process to get stuck
