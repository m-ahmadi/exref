# This shows the small fraction of positive samples.
#=================================================
# Clean, split and normalize the data
# The raw data has a few issues. First the `Time` and `Amount` columns are too variable to use directly.
# Drop the `Time` column (since it's not clear what it means) and take the log of the `Amount` column to reduce its range.

# Split the dataset into train, validation, and test sets.
# The validation set is used during the model fitting to evaluate the loss and any metrics, however the model is not fit with this data.
# The test set is completely unused during the training phase and is only used at the end to evaluate how well the model generalizes to new data.
# This is especially important with imbalanced datasets where overfitting is a significant concern from the lack of training data.

# Good questions to ask yourself at this point are:
#		Do these distributions make sense? 
#			Yes. You've normalized the input and these are mostly concentrated in the `+/- 2` range.
#		Can you see the difference between the distributions?
#			Yes the positive examples contain a much higher rate of extreme values.

# Understanding useful metrics
# Notice that there are a few metrics defined above that can be computed by the model that will be helpful when evaluating the performance.
# 	false negatives/false positives:    samples that were incorrectly classified
# 	true  negatives/true  positives:    samples that were correctly   classified
#		Accuracy:     percentage of examples correctly classified (true samples / total samples)
#		Precision:    percentage of predicted positives that were correctly classified (true positives / true positives + false positives)
#		Recall:       percentage of actual positives that were correctly classified (true positives / true positives + false negatives)
#		AUC:          refers to the Area Under the Curve of a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). This metric is equal to the probability that a classifier will rank a random positive sample higher than a random negative sample.
#		AUPRC:        refers to Area Under the Curve of the Precision-Recall Curve. This metric computes precision-recall pairs for different probability thresholds. 
# 
# Note: Accuracy is not a helpful metric for this task. You can 99.8%+ accuracy on this task by predicting False all the time.

# If the batch size was too small, they would likely have no fraudulent transactions to learn from.
# Note: this model will not handle the class imbalance well. You will improve it later in this tutorial.

#=================================================
# Optional: Set the correct initial bias.
# These initial guesses are not great. You know the dataset is imbalanced.
# Set the output layer's bias to reflect that (See: [A Recipe for Training Neural Networks: "init well"](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/#2-set-up-the-end-to-end-trainingevaluation-skeleton--get-dumb-baselines)). This can help with initial convergence.

# Applying this tutorial to your problem
# Imbalanced data classification is an inherently difficult task since there are so few samples to learn from.
# You should always start with the data first and do your best to collect as many samples as possible and
#  give substantial thought to what features may be relevant so the model can get the most out of your minority class.
# At some point your model may struggle to improve and yield the results you want,
# so it is important to keep in mind the context of your problem and the trade offs between different types of errors.
