level:		baseline value for the series if it were a straight line
trend:		optional and often linear increasing/decreasing behavior of the series over time
seasonality:	optional repeating patterns or cycles of behavior over time
noise:		optional variability in observations that cannot be explained by the model

all time series have a level, most have noise, and the trend and seasonality are optional.

dynamic time warping (dwt)	measuring similarity between two temporal sequences, which may vary in speed.
