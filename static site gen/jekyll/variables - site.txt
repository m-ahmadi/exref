site.<variable_name>

time			The current time (when you run the jekyll command).

pages			A list of all Pages.

posts			A reverse chronological list of all Posts.

categories.CATEGORY	The list of all Posts in category CATEGORY.

tags.TAG		The list of all Posts with tag TAG.

related_posts
	If the page being processed is a Post, this contains a list of up to ten related Posts.
	By default, these are the ten most recent posts.
	For high quality but slow to compute results, run the jekyll command with the --lsi (latent semantic indexing) option.
	Also note GitHub Pages does not support the lsi option when generating sites.

static_files
	A list of all static files (i.e. files not processed by Jekyll's converters or the Liquid renderer).
	Each file has five properties: path, modified_time, name, basename and extname.

url	
	Contains the url of your site as it is configured in the _config.yml.
	For example, if you have url: http://mysite.com in your configuration file, then it will be accessible in Liquid as site.url.
	For the development environment there is an exception,
	if you are running jekyll serve in a development environment site.url will be set to the value of host, port, and SSL-related options.
	This defaults to url: http://localhost:4000.

[CONFIGURATION_DATA]
	All the variables set via the command line and your _config.yml are available through the site variable.
	For example, if you have foo: bar in your configuration file, then it will be accessible in Liquid as site.foo.
	Jekyll does not parse changes to _config.yml in watch mode, you must restart Jekyll to see changes to variables.
