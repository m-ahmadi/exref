self-loop:            a link that connects a node to itself. (anomaly)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
parallel links:       two links that connect the same pair of vertices. (anomaly)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
multigraphs:          graphs with parallel links.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
simple graphs:        graphs with no parallel links or self-loops.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
incident link:        when an link connects two nodes. (one link is incident to both nodes.)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
adjacent nodes:       two nodes connected via one link.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
degree of a node:     the number of links incident to that node.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
subgraph:             a subset of a graph's links (and associated nodes) that constitutes a graph.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
path:                 a sequence of nodes connected by links.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
simple path:          a path with no repeated nodes.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
cycle:                a path with at least one link whose first and last nodes are the same.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
simple cycle:         a cycle with no repeated links or nodes. (except first and last nodes)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
path/cycle length:    the number of links of a path or cycle.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
connected graph:      when there is a path from every node to every other node in the graph.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
not connected graph:  when there is a set of connected components, which are maximum connected subgraphs.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
component:            a subgraph in which any two nodes are connected to each other by paths, and which is connected to no additional nodes in the supergraph.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
acyclic graph:        a graph with no cycles.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
tree:                 an acyclic connected graph.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
forest:               a disjoint set of trees is called a forest.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
spanning tree of a connected graph:

a subgraph that contains all of that graph's nodes and is a single tree.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
spanning forest of a graph:

	the union of spanning trees of its connected components.
