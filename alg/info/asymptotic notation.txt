θ Theta notaion
	Theta notaion is a pretty easy notaion to master, because all you do is:
		Drop low-order terms from the formula, and
		Ignore leading constants

Ex:	3n³ + 90n² - 5n + 6046
	n³ is a bigger term than n², so we drop n2 and n
	and we ignore the leading constants so:
	3n³ + 90n² - 5n + 6046  =  θ(n³)
	
	As n approaches infinity, a theta n-squared algorithm always beats a theta n-cubed algorithm.
	As n→∞, a θ(n²) alg always beats a (θ³) alg.
