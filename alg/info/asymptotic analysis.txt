What's an algorithm w-c time?
    Depends on Computer
    Relative speed  (compare 2 algorithms on same machine)
    Absolute speed  (is 1 algorithm better no matter what machine is run on)

BIG IDEA:  Asymptotic Analysis

	1.  Ignore machine dependent constants

	2.  Look at the growth of runing time instead of actual running time
