Worst-Case Analysis (usually)

	T(n) = max time on any input of size n
___________________________________________________________________________________

Average    Analysis    (sometimes)

	T(n) = expected time of all inputs of size n
	
	expected time:
		It's the time of every input times the probability that'll be that

	How do i know what the probability of every input is?
		I don't, I have to make an assumption.
		What's that assumption called?
		Assumption of statistical of distribution

	Cheat
	A slow algorithm that works fast on some input
