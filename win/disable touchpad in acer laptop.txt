the way i disabled touchpad permanently:
(not tried to enable it again, to see if everything is ok)

1. uninstall synaptics driver. (not from add/remove softwares, from prompted dialogue when opening mouse in control panel)
2. uninstall elantech driver. (from add/remove softwares)
3. devmgmt.msc -> Mice and other pointing devices -> PS/2 Compatible Mouse -> Uninstall
4. restart pc
5. devmgmt.msc -> Mice and other pointing devices -> PS/2 Compatible Mouse -> Disable

if you don't disable it (step 5), windows will install it again automatically after a restart.
