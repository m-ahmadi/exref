add drivers to win7.iso
create MBR usb with rufus from the iso
rufus settings:
	Partition scheme:	"MBR"
	Target system: 		"BIOS (or UEFI-CSM)"
	File system: 		"NTFS"
	(rufus detects automatically and sets to NTFS if .iso is larger than 4GB)
restart
initial boot from non-UEFI usb drive
subsequent boots from nvme drive
done

note: creating GPT usb causes 0xc428 error that I was unable to fix.
