pushd %windir%\system32\drivers\etc
takeown /f hosts && icacls hosts /grant administrators:F
attrib -r -h -s hosts
--------------------------------------------------
why this happens?

probably due to scripts in some program's crack that try to disable
access to some servers, so they modify the `hosts` file, and perhaps
some even take ownership and permissions of the file as well.
