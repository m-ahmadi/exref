after a particular market move, prices retrace a portion of the previous trend before resuming the move in the original direction,
these countertrend moves tend to fall into certain predictable percentage parameters.

percentage retracements apply to any degree of trend: major, secondary, near term.

50% retracement
the best known application of the retracement phenomenon is the 50% retracement.
in a market that is trending higher, often the subsequent reaction retraces about half of the prior move, before upward momentum is regained.
it's a very well known market tendency and happens quite frequently.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
minimum & maximum retracements

the price trend is divided into thirds.

33% retracement (one-third/minimum)
in a correction of a strong trend, the market usually retraces at least a third of the previous move.

66% retracement (two-thirds/maximum)
it's an especially critical area.
if the prior trend is to be maintained, the correction must stop at the two-thirds point.
a relatively low risk buying area in an uptrend or selling area in a downtrend.
if prices move beyond the two-thirds point:
	the odds favor a trend reversal rather than a retracement.
	the move usually then retraces the entire 100% of the prior trend.

usage
a 33-50% price zone can be used as a general frame of reference for buying opportunities.

in combination with other theories
3 percentage retracement parameters (50%, 33%, 66%) are taken right from the original dow theory.
elliott wave theory and fibonacci approach use percentage retracements of 38% and 62%.

combining both approaches (percentage & fibonacci)
minimum retracement zone:    33-38%
maximum retracement zone:    62-66%
we could round off these numbers and have a 40-60% retracement zone.

w. d. gann broke down the trend structure into eighths.
V8, 2/8, 3/8, 4/8, 5/8, 6/8, 7/8, 8/8.
he attached special importance to the 3/8 (38%), 4/8 (50%), and 5/8 (62%) retracement numbers.
he also felt it was important to divide the trend into thirds, 1/3 (33%) and 2/3 (66%).
