moving average:
	is an average of a certain body of data.
	identifies if a new trend has begun or an old trend has ended or reversed.
	is a follower, not a leader.
	never anticipates, it only reacts.
	is not a curving trendline.
	functions in the same senses that standard chart analysis do.
	smoothes the data, making the underlying trend clearer.
	by its nature, lags the market action. (less lag with shorter averages, but never completely eliminated)

commonly used time frames
	10-20		short term
	50		mid   term
	200		long  term

which prices to use
close		most common
midpoint	dividing the day's range by two: median(high,low) aka `midrange` in statistics
hlc		high + low + close / 3
price-bands	average of high and low separately (volatility buffer or neutral zone)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
types of moving averages:

basic types: simple weighted exponential

simple moving average
	average of last N days
	criticism:
		only the period covered by the average is taken into account
		it gives equal weight to each day (some say more recent days should weight heavier)

linearly weighted
	weighted average of last N days
	(1st day * 1) + ... + (10th day * 10) / sum_of_weights=55
	criticism:
		only the period covered by the average is taken into account

exponentially smoothed
	weighted average of all previous day (different weights for the days though)
	weight of last day depends on the number of periods in the moving average
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
usage

generate trend signals
	buy  signal:		when close price moves above moving average
	sell signal:		when close price moves below moving average
	extra confirmation:	if moving average line itself turns in direction of the price crossing

short average (5|10)
	very sensitive and tracks price very closely so several crossings occur
	the shorter the average, the closer it follows the price trend
	generates earlier signals in the move
	works better when trend is in the process of reversing
	
	produces more trades (higher commission)
	results in many false signals (whipsaws)
	random price movement (noise) activates bad trend signals
	
long average
	tracks price from a greater distance
	does not get tangled up in short term corrections during the trend
	works better as long as the trend remains in force
	
	its insensitivity works against the trader when trend actually reverses

finding an average sensitive enough to generate early signals but insensitive enough to avoid most noises is a tradeoff
using only one moving average has several disadvantages and it's best to use two
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
two moving averages (double crossover)

this technique lags the market a bit more than a single average but produces fewer whipsaws

buy signal:	when shorter average crosses above the longer

popular combinations
	5  and 20 day (buy when 5 crosses above 20, sell when 5 moves below 20)
	10 and 50 day (... 10 above 50 signals uptrend, 10 under 50 signals downtrend)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4-9-18 day moving average system

shortest average follows the trend most closely

proper alignment
	in uptrend	4 above 9 and 9 above 18
	in downtrend	4 lowest, followed by 9 and then 18 (exact opposite of uptrend)

in downtrend
	buy alert:		when 4 crosses above both 9 and 18
	confirmed buy signal:	when 9 day crosses above 18 (4 over 9, 9 over 18)
	general uptrend remains intact despite of some intermingling of averages during corrections or consolidations
	during intermingling some might buy more and some might take profit (depending on how aggressively one wants to trade)

in uptred
	sell alert:		when 4 dips below 9 and 18 (might be enough for some traders to liquidate longs, sign that uptrend reversing to the downside)
	confirmed sell signal:	when 9 drops below 18 (or sell short signal)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
moving average envelopes
	can enhance a single moving average
	help determine when market has gotten overextended in either direction (prices have strayed too far from their moving average line)

envelopes are placed at fixed percentages above and below the average
trend is considered overextended when prices reach one of the envelopes

common in short term
	3% envelopes around a simple 21 day average

possible combinations for long term
	5% envelopes around a 10 week average
	10% envelope around a 40 week average
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bollinger bands (developed by john bollinger)

bollinger bands
	are two trading bands placed around a moving average similar to envelopes, except they
	are placed two standard deviations above and below a (usually) 20 day moving average
	can also be applied to weekly/monthly charts by using 20 week/month instead of 20 day
	work best when combined with overbought/oversold oscillators
	bandwidth measures volatility
	tend to alternate between expansion and contraction
	
standard deviation describes how prices are dispersed around an average value and using two ensures that 95% of price data falls between the two bands

prices are considered
	overextended upside   (overbought)	when prices touch upper band
	overextended downside (oversold)	when prices touch lower band

using bands as price targets
	if prices bounce off lower band and cross above 20 day average, upper band becomes target
	a crossing below 20 day average would identify the lower band as target

in a strong uptrend
	prices usually fluctuate between upper band and the average
	a crossing below the average warns of a trend reversal to the downside

major difference of bollinger bands and envelopes
	envelopes stay a constant percentage width apart
	bollinger bands expand and contract based on last 20 days' volatility

distance between the bands
	will widen 		during a period of rising price volatility
	will contract		during a period of low    price volatility

when bands are unusually far apart:		a sign (often) that current trend may be ending
when bands are too close to near each other:	a sign (often) that a new   trend may be starting:	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
centering the average

plotting a moving average in middle of the time period it covers (instead of at end)
	10 day average		5  days back
	20 day average 		10 days back

more statistically correct
major flaw of producing much later trend change signals

usually not used (averages usually placed at end)
this technique is used almost exclusively by cyclic analysts to isolate underlying market cycles
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
moving averages tied to cycles

time cycles
	play an important role in market movement (many believe)
	used to determine the approximate times when market tops or bottoms will occur (since cycles are repetitive and can be measured)

many different cycles from 5 day to 54 year (kondratieff) exist simultaneously
there seems to be a relationship between underlying cycles that affect a certain market and the correct moving averages to use
moving averages can be adjusted to fit the dominant cycles in each market

There appears to be a definite relationship between moving averages and cycles.

example
	monthly cycle operates heavily in commodity markets
	cycles (tend to) relate to next longer & shorter cycles harmonically or by a factor of two
	
	a month:		20-21 trading days
	next longer  cycle:	double the length
	next shorter cycle:	half   the length
	
	might explain popularity of 5 10 20 40 day averages
	
	20 day cycle		measures monthly cycle
	40 day average		double the 20 day
	10 day average		half    of 20 
	5  day average 		half    of 10

cyclic influences & harmonic relationships of neighboring cycles can explain many commonly used moving averages (including 4-9-18 day, which are derivatives of 5, 10, 20) 
4 week cycle might explain the success of 4 week rule (and 2 week rule)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fibonacci numbers used as moving averages

fib number series (13, 21, 34, 55, ...) seem to lend themselves quite well to moving average analysis

true for daily & weekly charts

21 day  average is a fib number
13 week average is a fib number (and has proven valuable in both stocks and commodities)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
moving averages applied to long term charts

proven to be useful in longer range trend analysis

10 13 30 40 week	have long been used in stock market (but not so much in futures)
10 and 40   week	used to help track primary trend (futures & stocks)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
some pros and cons of moving average

pro
	so popular as trend-following systems
	they embody some of the oldest maxims of successful trading
	they trade in direction of trend
	they let profit run and cut loss short
	they force user to obey the rules by providing specific buy/sell signals based on principles
	they work best when market is in trending period (due to being trend-following in nature)
	they can't be beat in (certain) trending markets (just switch to automatic)
con

	they perform very poorly when market gets choppy and trade sideways for a period of time (and that might be a third to half the time)
	dangerous to rely too heavily on them (since do not work (that well) most of the time ↑)
	a nontrending methods like over-bought/sold oscillator is more appropriate in nontrending market

adx indicator tells
	when market is trending and when is not
	whether market climate favors a trending moving average technique or a nontrending oscillator approach

THE WEEKLY RULE
There are other alternatives to the moving average as a trend-following
device. One of the best known and most successful of
these techniques is called the weekly price channel or, simply, the
weekly rule. This technique has many of the benefits of the moving
average, but is less time consuming and simpler to use.
With the improvements in computer technology over the
past decade, a considerable amount of research has been done on
the development of technical trading systems. These systems are
mechanical in nature, meaning that human emotion and judgment
are eliminated. These systems have become increasingly
sophisticated. At first, simple moving averages were utilized.
Then, double and triple crossovers of the averages were added.
The averages were then linearly weighted and exponentially
smoothed. These systems are primarily trend-following, which
means their purpose is to identify and then trade in the direction
of an existing trend.
With the increased fascination with fancier and more complex
systems and indicators, however, there has been a tendency
to overlook some of the simpler techniques that continue to work
quite well and have stood the test of time. We're going to discuss
one of the simplest of these techniques-the weekly rule.
In 1970, a booklet entitled the Trader's Notebook was published
by Dunn & Hargitt's Financial Services in Lafayette,
Indiana. The best known commodity trading systems of the day
were computer-tested and compared. The final conclusion of all
that research was that the most successful of all the systems tested
was the 4 week rule, developed by Richard Donchian. Mr.

Donchian has been recognized as a pioneer in the field of commodity
trend trading using mechanical systems. (In 1983,
Managed Account Reports chose Donchian as the first recipient of
the Most Valuable Performer Award for outstanding contributions
to the field of futures money management, and presents The
Donchian Award to other worthy recipients.)
More recent work done by Louis Lukac, former research
director at Dunn & Hargitt and currently president of Wizard
Trading (a Massachusetts CTA) supports the earlier conclusions
that breakout ( or channel) systems similar to the weekly rule continue
to show superior results. (Lukac et al.)*
Of the 12 systems tested from 1975-84, only 4 generated
significant profits. Of those 4, 2 were channel breakout systems
and one was a dual moving average crossover system. A later article
by Lukac and Brorsen in The Financial Review (November 1990)
published the results of a more extensive study done on data from
1976-86 that compared 23 technical trading systems. Once again,
channel breakouts and moving average systems came out on top.
Lukac finally concluded that a channel breakout system was his
personal choice as the best starting point for all technical trading
system testing and development.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 4 Week Rule
The 4 week rule is used primarily for futures trading.
The system based on the 4 week rule is simplicity itself:
1. Cover short positions and buy long whenever the price
exceeds the highs of the four preceding full calendar weeks.
2. Liquidate long positions and sell short whenever the price
falls below the lows of the four preceding full calendar weeks.
The system, as it is presented here, is continuous in nature,
which means that the trader always has a position, either long or
short. As a general rule, continuous systems have a basic weakness.
They stay in the market and get "whipsawed" during trendless market
periods. It's already been stressed that trend-following systems do not
work well when markets are in these sideways, or trendless phases.
* See Bibliography

The 4 week rule can be modified to make it noncontinuous.
This can be accomplished by using a shorter time span-such
as a one or two week rule-for liquidation purposes. In other
words, a four week "breakout" would be necessary to initiate a
new position, but a one or two week signal in the opposite direction
would warrant liquidation of the position. The trader would
then remain out of the market until a new four week breakout is
registered.
The logic behind the system is based on sound technical
principles. Its signals are mechanical and clearcut. Because it is
trend following, it virtually guarantees participation on the
right side of every important trend. It is also structured to follow
the often quoted maxim of successful trading-"let profits
run, while cutting losses short." Another feature, which should
not be overlooked, is that this method tends to trade less frequently,
so that commissions are lower. Another plus is that
the system can be implemented with or without the aid of a
computer.
The main criticism of the weekly rule is the same one leveled
against all trend-following approaches, namely, that it does
not catch tops or bottoms. But what trend-following system
does? The important point to keep in mind is that the four week
rule performs at least as well as most other trend-following systems
and better than many, but has the added benefit of incredible
simplicity.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adjustments to the 4 Week Rule
Although we're treating the four week rule in its original form,
there are many adjustments and refinements that can be
employed. For one thing, the rule does not have to be used as a
trading system. Weekly signals can be employed simply as another
technical indicator to identify breakouts and trend reversals.
Weekly breakouts can be used as a confirming filter for other techniques,
such as moving average crossovers. One or 2 week rules
function as excellent filters. A moving average crossover signal
could be confirmed by a two week breakout in the same direction
in order for a market position to be taken.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shorten or Lengthen Time Periods
for Sensitivity
Chapter 9
The time period employed can be expanded or compressed in the
interests of risk management and sensitivity. For example, the
time period could be shortened if it is desirable to make the system
more sensitive. In a relatively high priced market, where
prices are trending sharply higher, a shorter time span could be
chosen to make the system more sensitive. Suppose, for example,
that a long position is taken on a 4 week upside breakout with a
protective stop placed just below the low of the past 2 weeks. If
the market has rallied sharply and the trader wishes to trail the
position with a closer protective stop, a one week stopout point
could be used.
In a trading range situation, where a trend trader would
just as soon stay on the sidelines until an important trend signal
is given, the time period could be expanded to eight weeks. This
would prevent taking positions on shorter term and premature
trend signals.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 4 Week Rule Tied to Cycles
Earlier in the chapter reference was made to the importance of the
monthly cycle in commodity markets. The 4 week, or 20 day,
trading cycle is a dominant cycle that influences all markets. This
may help explain why the 4 week time period has proven so successful.
Notice that mention was made of 1, 2, and 8 week rules.
The principle of harmonics in cyclic analysis holds that each cycle
is related to its neighboring cycles (next longer and next shorter
cycles) by 2.
In the previous discussion of moving averages, it was
pointed out how the monthly cycle and harmonics explained the
popularity of the 5, 10, 20, and 40 day moving averages. The same
time periods hold true in the realm of weekly rules. Those daily
numbers translated into weekly time periods are 1, 2, 4, and 8
weeks. Therefore, adjustments to the 4 week rule seem to work
best when the beginning number (4) is divided or multiplied by
2. To shorten the time span, go from 4 to 2 weeks. If an even
shorter time span is desired, go from 2 to 1. To lengthen, go from

4 to 8. Because this method combines price and time, there's no
reason why the cyclic principle of harmonics should not play an
important role. The tactic of dividing a weekly parameter by 2 to
shorten it, or doubling it to lengthen it, does have cycle logic
behind it.
The 4 week rule is a simple breakout system. The original
system can be modified by using a shorter time period-a 1 or 2
week rule-for liquidation purposes. If the user desires a more sensitive
system, a 2 week period can be employed for entry signals.
Because this rule is meant to be simple, it is best addressed on that
level. The 4 week rule is simple, but it works.(Charting packages
allow you to plot price channels above and below current prices to
spot channel breakouts. Price channels can be used on daily,
weekly, or monthly charts. See Figures 9.11 and 9.12.)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO OPTIMIZE OR NOT
The first edition of this book included the results of extensive
research produced by Merrill Lynch, which published a series of
studies on computerized trading techniques applied to the futures
markets from 1978-82. Extensive testing of various moving average
and channel breakout parameters was performed to find the
best possible combinations in each futures market. The Merrill
Lynch researchers produced a different set of optimized indicator
values for each market.
Most charting packages allow you to optimize systems and
indicators. Instead of using the same moving average in all markets,
for example, you could ask the computer to find the moving
average, or moving average combinations, that have worked the
best in the past for that market. That could also be done for daily

and weekly breakout systems and virtually all technical indicators
included in this book. Optimization allows technical parameters
to adapt to changing market conditions.
Some argue that optimization helps their trading results
and others that it doesn't. The heart of the debate centers on how
the data is optimized. Researchers stress that the correct procedure
is to use only part of the price data to choose the best parameters,
and another portion to actually test the results. Testing the optimized
parameters on "out of sample" price data helps ensure that
the final results will be closer to what one might experience from
actual trading.
The decision to optimize or not is a personal one. Most evidence,
however, suggests that optimization is not the Holy Grail
some think it to be. I generally advise traders following only a
handful of markets to experiment with optimization. Why should
Treasury Bonds or the German mark have the exact same moving
averages as corn or cotton? Stock market traders are a different
story. Having to follow thousands of stocks argues against optimizing.
If you specialize in a handful of markets, try optimizing.
If you're a generalist who follows a large number of markets, use
the same technical parameters for all of them.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
We've presented a lot of variations on the moving average
approach. Let's try to simplify things a bit. Most technicians use
a combination of two moving averages. Those two averages are
usually simple averages. Although exponential averages have
become popular, there's no real evidence to prove that they work
any better than the simple average. The most commonly used
daily moving average combinations in futures markets are 4 and
9, 9 and 18, 5 and 20, and 10 and 40. Stock traders rely heavily
on a SO day ( or 10 week) moving average. For longer range stock
market analysis, popular weekly moving averages are 30 and 40
weeks (or 200 days). Bollinger Bands make use of 20 day and 20
week moving averages. The 20 week average can be converted to
daily charts by utilizing a 100 day average, which is another use

ful moving average. Channel breakout systems work extremely
well in trending markets and can be used on daily, weekly, and
monthly charts.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE ADAPTIVE
MOVING AVERAGE
One of the problems encountered with the moving average is
choosing between a fast or a slow average. While one may work
better in a trading range market, the other may be preferable in a
trending market. The answer to the problem of choosing between
the two may lie with an innovative approach called the "adaptive
moving average."
Perry Kaufman presents this technique in his book Smarter
Trading. The speed of Kaufman's "adaptive moving average" automatically
adjusts to the level of noise (or volatility) in a market.
The AMA moves more slowly when markets are trending sideways,
but then moves more swiftly when the market is trending.
That avoids the problem of using a faster moving average (and
getting whipsawed more frequently) during a trading range, and
using a slower average that trails too far behind a market when it
is trending.
Kaufman does that by constructing an Efficiency Ratio that
compares price direction with the level of volatility. When the
Efficiency Ratio is high, there is more direction than volatility
(favoring a faster average). When the ratio is low, there's more
volatility than direction (favoring a slower average). By incorporating
the Efficiency Ratio, the AMA automatically adjusts to the
speed most suitable for the current market.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALTERN ATIVES TO THE
MOVING AVERAGE
223
Moving averages don't work all of the time. They do their best
work when the market is in a trending phase. They're not very
helpful during trendless periods when prices trade sideways.
Fortunately, there's another class of indicator that performs much
better than the moving average during those frustrating trading
ranges. They're called oscillators and we'll explain them in the
next chapter.
