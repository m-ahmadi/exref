moving average:
	is an average of a certain body of data.
	identifies if a new trend has begun or an old trend has ended or reversed.
	is a follower, not a leader.
	never anticipates, it only reacts.
	is not a curving trendline.
	functions in the same senses that standard chart analysis do.
	smoothes the data, making the underlying trend clearer.
	by its nature, lags the market action. (less lag with shorter averages, but never completely eliminated)

commonly used time frames
10-20	for short term
50	for mid   term
200	for long  term

which prices to use
close		most common
midpoint	dividing the day's range by two: median(high,low) aka `midrange` in statistics
hlc		high + low + close / 3
price-bands	average of high and low separately (volatility buffer or neutral zone)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
types of moving averages:

basic types: simple weighted exponential

simple moving average
	average of last N days
	criticism:
		only the period covered by the average is taken into account
		it gives equal weight to each day (some say more recent days should weight heavier)

linearly weighted
	weighted average of last N days
	(1st day * 1) + ... + (10th day * 10) / sum_of_weights=55
	criticism:
		only the period covered by the average is taken into account

exponentially smoothed
	weighted average of all previous day (different weights for the days though)
	weight of last day depends on the number of periods in the moving average

usage

generate trend signals
	buy  signal:		when close price moves above moving average
	sell signal:		when close price moves below moving average
	extra confirmation:	if moving average line itself turns in direction of the price crossing

short average (5|10)
	very sensitive and tracks price very closely so several crossings occur
	the shorter the average, the closer it follows the price trend
	generates earlier signals in the move
	works better when trend is in the process of reversing
	
	produces more trades (higher commission)
	results in many false signals (whipsaws)
	random price movement (noise) activates bad trend signals
	
long average
	tracks price from a greater distance
	does not get tangled up in short term corrections during the trend
	works better as long as the trend remains in force
	
	its insensitivity works against the trader when trend actually reverses

finding an average sensitive enough to generate early signals but insensitive enough to avoid most noises is a tradeoff
using only one moving average has several disadvantages and it's best to use two
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
two moving averages (double crossover)

this technique lags the market a bit more than a single average but produces fewer whipsaws

buy signal:	when shorter average crosses above the longer

popular combinations
	5  and 20 day (buy when 5 crosses above 20, sell when 5 moves below 20)
	10 and 50 day (... 10 above 50 signals uptrend, 10 under 50 signals downtrend)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4-9-18 day moving average system

shortest average follows the trend most closely

proper alignment
	in uptrend	4 above 9 and 9 above 18
	in downtrend	4 lowest, followed by 9 and then 18 (exact opposite of uptrend)

in downtrend
	buy alert:		when 4 crosses above both 9 and 18
	confirmed buy signal:	when 9 day crosses above 18 (4 over 9, 9 over 18)
	general uptrend remains intact despite of some intermingling of averages during corrections or consolidations
	during intermingling some might buy more and some might take profit (depending on how aggressively one wants to trade)

in uptred
	sell alert:		when 4 dips below 9 and 18 (might be enough for some traders to liquidate longs, sign that uptrend reversing to the downside)
	confirmed sell signal:	when 9 drops below 18 (or sell short signal)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
moving average envelopes
	can enhance a single moving average
	help determine when market has gotten overextended in either direction (prices have strayed too far from their moving average line)

envelopes are placed at fixed percentages above and below the average
trend is considered overextended when prices reach one of the envelopes

common in short term
	3% envelopes around a simple 21 day average

possible combinations for long term
	5% envelopes around a 10 week average
	10% envelope around a 40 week average

bollinger bands (developed by John Bollinger)

two bands are placed two standard deviations above and below a (usually) 20 days moving average
standard deviation describes how prices are dispersed around an average value and using two ensures that 95% of price data falls between the two bands

prices are considered
	overextended upside   (overbought)	when prices touch upper band
	overextended downside (oversold)	when prices touch lower band

using bands as price targets
	if prices bounce off lower band and cross above 20 day average, upper band becomes target
	a crossing below 20 day average would identify the lower band as target

in a strong uptrend
	prices usually fluctuate between upper band and the average
	a crossing below the average warns of a trend reversal to the downside
