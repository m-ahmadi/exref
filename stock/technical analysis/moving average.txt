moving average:
	is an average of a certain body of data.
	identifies if a new trend has begun or an old trend has ended or reversed.
	is a follower, not a leader.
	never anticipates, it only reacts.
	is not a curving trendline.
	functions in the same senses that standard chart analysis do.
	smoothes the data, making the underlying trend clearer.
	by its nature, lags the market action. (less lag with shorter averages, but never completely eliminated)

commonly used time frames
10-20	for short term
50	for mid   term
200	for long  term

which prices to use
close
midpoint	dividing the day's range by two: median(high,low)
hlc		high + low + close / 3
price-bands	average of high and low separately (volatility buffer or neutral zone)

types of moving averages:

basic types: simple weighted exponential

simple moving average
	average of last N days
	criticism:
		only the period covered by the average is taken into account
		it gives equal weight to each day (some say more recent days should weight heavier)

linearly weighted
	weighted average of last N days
	(1st day * 1) + ... + (10th day * 10) / sum_of_weights=55
	criticism:
		only the period covered by the average is taken into account

exponentially smoothed
	weighted average of all previous day
	the weight of last day depends on the number of periods in the moving average

1.	calculate the simple moving average for the initial EMA value
	EMA has to start somewhere, so a SMA is used as the previous period's EMA in the first calculation.

2.	calculate the weighting multiplier.

3. 	calculate the exponential moving average for each day between the initial EMA value and today, using the price, the multiplier, and the previous period's EMA value.
