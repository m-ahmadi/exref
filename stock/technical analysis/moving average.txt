moving average:
	is an average of a certain body of data.
	identifies if a new trend has begun or an old trend has ended or reversed.
	is a follower, not a leader.
	never anticipates, it only reacts.
	is not a curving trendline.
	functions in the same senses that standard chart analysis do.
	smoothes the data, making the underlying trend clearer.
	by its nature, lags the market action. (less lag with shorter averages, but never completely eliminated)

commonly used time frames
	10-20		short term
	50		mid   term
	200		long  term

which prices to use
close		most common
midpoint	dividing the day's range by two: median(high,low) aka `midrange` in statistics
hlc		high + low + close / 3
price-bands	average of high and low separately (volatility buffer or neutral zone)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
types of moving averages:

basic types: simple weighted exponential

simple moving average
	average of last N days
	criticism:
		only the period covered by the average is taken into account
		it gives equal weight to each day (some say more recent days should weight heavier)

linearly weighted
	weighted average of last N days
	(1st day * 1) + ... + (10th day * 10) / sum_of_weights=55
	criticism:
		only the period covered by the average is taken into account

exponentially smoothed
	weighted average of all previous day (different weights for the days though)
	weight of last day depends on the number of periods in the moving average
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
usage

generate trend signals
	buy  signal:		when close price moves above moving average
	sell signal:		when close price moves below moving average
	extra confirmation:	if moving average line itself turns in direction of the price crossing

short average (5|10)
	very sensitive and tracks price very closely so several crossings occur
	the shorter the average, the closer it follows the price trend
	generates earlier signals in the move
	works better when trend is in the process of reversing
	
	produces more trades (higher commission)
	results in many false signals (whipsaws)
	random price movement (noise) activates bad trend signals
	
long average
	tracks price from a greater distance
	does not get tangled up in short term corrections during the trend
	works better as long as the trend remains in force
	
	its insensitivity works against the trader when trend actually reverses

finding an average sensitive enough to generate early signals but insensitive enough to avoid most noises is a tradeoff
using only one moving average has several disadvantages and it's best to use two
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
two moving averages (double crossover)

this technique lags the market a bit more than a single average but produces fewer whipsaws

buy signal:	when shorter average crosses above the longer

popular combinations
	5  and 20 day (buy when 5 crosses above 20, sell when 5 moves below 20)
	10 and 50 day (... 10 above 50 signals uptrend, 10 under 50 signals downtrend)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4-9-18 day moving average system

shortest average follows the trend most closely

proper alignment
	in uptrend	4 above 9 and 9 above 18
	in downtrend	4 lowest, followed by 9 and then 18 (exact opposite of uptrend)

in downtrend
	buy alert:		when 4 crosses above both 9 and 18
	confirmed buy signal:	when 9 day crosses above 18 (4 over 9, 9 over 18)
	general uptrend remains intact despite of some intermingling of averages during corrections or consolidations
	during intermingling some might buy more and some might take profit (depending on how aggressively one wants to trade)

in uptred
	sell alert:		when 4 dips below 9 and 18 (might be enough for some traders to liquidate longs, sign that uptrend reversing to the downside)
	confirmed sell signal:	when 9 drops below 18 (or sell short signal)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
moving average envelopes
	can enhance a single moving average
	help determine when market has gotten overextended in either direction (prices have strayed too far from their moving average line)

envelopes are placed at fixed percentages above and below the average
trend is considered overextended when prices reach one of the envelopes

common in short term
	3% envelopes around a simple 21 day average

possible combinations for long term
	5% envelopes around a 10 week average
	10% envelope around a 40 week average
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bollinger bands (developed by john bollinger)

bollinger bands
	are two trading bands placed around a moving average similar to envelopes, except they
	are placed two standard deviations above and below a (usually) 20 day moving average
	can also be applied to weekly/monthly charts by using 20 week/month instead of 20 day
	work best when combined with overbought/oversold oscillators
	bandwidth measures volatility
	tend to alternate between expansion and contraction
	
standard deviation describes how prices are dispersed around an average value and using two ensures that 95% of price data falls between the two bands

prices are considered
	overextended upside   (overbought)	when prices touch upper band
	overextended downside (oversold)	when prices touch lower band

using bands as price targets
	if prices bounce off lower band and cross above 20 day average, upper band becomes target
	a crossing below 20 day average would identify the lower band as target

in a strong uptrend
	prices usually fluctuate between upper band and the average
	a crossing below the average warns of a trend reversal to the downside

major difference of bollinger bands and envelopes
	envelopes stay a constant percentage width apart
	bollinger bands expand and contract based on last 20 days' volatility

distance between the bands
	will widen 		during a period of rising price volatility
	will contract		during a period of low    price volatility

when bands are unusually far apart:		a sign (often) that current trend may be ending
when bands are too close to near each other:	a sign (often) that a new   trend may be starting:	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
centering the average

plotting a moving average in middle of the time period it covers (instead of at end)
	10 day average		5  days back
	20 day average 		10 days back

more statistically correct
major flaw of producing much later trend change signals

usually not used (averages usually placed at end)
this technique is used almost exclusively by cyclic analysts to isolate underlying market cycles
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
moving averages tied to cycles

time cycles
	play an important role in market movements (many believe)
	are used to determine the approximate times when market tops or bottoms will occur (since cycles are repetitive and can be measured)

many different cycles from 5 day to 54 year (kondratieff) exist simultaneously
there seems to be a relationship between underlying cycles that affect a certain market and correct moving averages to use
moving averages can be adjusted to fit the dominant cycles in each market

there appears to be a definite relationship between moving averages and cycles
example
	monthly cycle operates heavily in commodity markets
	cycles (tend to) relate to next longer & shorter cycles harmonically or by a factor of two
	
	a month:		20-21 trading days
	next longer  cycle:	double the length
	next shorter cycle:	half   the length
	
	might explain popularity of 5 10 20 40 day averages
	
	20 day cycle		measures monthly cycle
	40 day average		double the 20 day
	10 day average		half    of 20 
	5  day average 		half    of 10

cyclic influences & harmonic relationships of neighboring cycles can explain many commonly used moving averages (including 4-9-18 day, which are derivatives of 5, 10, 20) 
4 week cycle might explain the success of 4 week rule (and 2 week rule)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fibonacci numbers used as moving averages

fib number series (13, 21, 34, 55, ...) seem to lend themselves quite well to moving average analysis

true for daily & weekly charts

21 day  average is a fib number
13 week average is a fib number (and has proven valuable in both stocks and commodities)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
moving averages applied to long term charts

proven to be useful in longer range trend analysis

10 13 30 40 week	have long been used in stock market (but not so much in futures)
10 and 40   week	used to help track primary trend (futures & stocks)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
some pros and cons of moving average

pro
	so popular as trend-following systems
	they embody some of the oldest maxims of successful trading
	they trade in direction of trend
	they let profit run and cut loss short
	they force user to obey the rules by providing specific buy/sell signals based on principles
	they work best when market is in trending period (due to being trend-following in nature)
	they can't be beat in (certain) trending markets (just switch to automatic)
con

	they perform very poorly when market gets choppy and trade sideways for a period of time (and that might be a third to half the time)
	dangerous to rely too heavily on them (since do not work (that well) most of the time ↑)
	a nontrending methods like over-bought/sold oscillator is more appropriate in nontrending market

adx indicator tells
	when market is trending and when is not
	whether market climate favors a trending moving average technique or a nontrending oscillator approach
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
moving averages as oscillators

construct an oscillator
	compare difference between two moving averages (results in crossover technique to take on greater significance and become even more useful)
macd
	compares two exponentially smoothed averages
	is used partially as an oscillator
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
moving average applied to other technical data

moving average can be
	applied to virtually any technical data or indicator
	used on open interest and volume figures (including on balance volume)
	used on various indicators and ratios
	applied to oscillators as well
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
weekly rule

aka weekly price channel (developed by richard donchian)
most successful alternative trend-following device to the moving average
has many benefits of moving average but less time consuming and simpler to use
works quite well and have stood test of time
gets overlooked due to existence of fancier things
(technical trading systems development timeline: sma, doubl/triple crossover, lwma/esma)
general rule: trend-following systems dont work well in trendless phases

history
louis lukac suggest breakout (channel) systems show superior results (like weekly rule)
	12 systems tested from 1975-84
	4 generated significant profits (2 channel breakout, 1 dual crossover avg)
	
	23 systems tested from 1976-86
	extensive study done on data from 1976-86
	again channel breakout & moving average won
	
	channel breakout is great choice as a starting point system (says lokac)


4 week rule
	is a simple breakout system
	used primarily for futures
	tends to trade less frequently (lower commission)
	main criticism: does not catch tops or bottoms (same for all trend-following approaches)
	
	info:
		logic is based on sound technical principles
		mechanical and clearcut signals
		almost guarantees participation on right side of every important trend (due to being trend-following)
		structured to follow maxim of successful trading "let profits run, while cutting losses short."
		at least as good as most other trend-following systems and better than many

continuous (always in position, long or short)
	buy	when price exceeds      highs of past 4 full calendar weeks (buy long       & cover short)
	sell	when price falls below  lows  of past 4 full calendar weeks (liquidate long & sell  short)
	
	basic weakness: stays in market and get "whipsawed" during trendless periods

noncontinuous (shorter time span for sell, 1 or 2 week)			modifications 1 or 2 week for liquidation
	buy	...
	sell	... past 2 full calendar weeks

	remains out of market until a new 4 week breakout is registered

adjustments
	does not have to be a trading system
	using weekly signals as indicator to identify breakouts & trend reversals
	using weekly breakouts as confirming filter for moving average crossover (or other techniques)
	confirmed crossover signal:	2 week breakout in same direction
	excellent filters:		1 or 2 week rules

time period adjustment
	expand or compress for risk management & sensitivity
	
	shorter period:		more sensitive system. eg:2 week for entry (good when prices trending sharply higher, aka high priced market)
	
	trainling stop
		long position on 4 week upside breakout		stoploss at low of past 2 weeks
		if market sharp rally				stoploss at low of past   week
	
	8 week period		prevents position on shorter term & premature trend signals (if staying out until important trend signal is given, aka? trading range situation)


tied to cycles
	4 week (or 20 day) trading cycle is a dominant cycle that influences all markets (may explain success of 4 week period)
	
	remember that
		variations of 4 week rule were 1 2 8 week rules
		principle of harmonics in cyclic analysis holds that each cycle is related to its neighboring cycles by 2 (next longer & next shorter cycles)
		how monthly cycle & harmonics explained popularity of 5 10 20 40 day averages (line 178)

	same time periods hold true in weekly rules
	daily numbers translated to weekly periods	 1 2 4 8 week


	4 week rule adjustments seem to work best when 4 is divided or multiplied by 2 (this tactic has cycle logic behind it)
		to shorten		go from 4 to 2 week
		... even more		go from 2 to 1 week
		
		to lengthen		go from 4 to 8

	(in charting software: plot price channels above and below current prices to spot channel breakouts)

to optimize or not

The first edition of this book included the results of extensive research produced by Merrill Lynch, which published a series of studies on computerized trading techniques applied to the futures markets from 1978-82.
Extensive testing of various moving average and channel breakout parameters was performed to find the best possible combinations in each futures market.
The Merrill Lynch researchers produced a different set of optimized indicator values for each market.
Most charting packages allow you to optimize systems and indicators.
Instead of using the same moving average in all markets, for example, you could ask the computer to find the moving average, or moving average combinations, that have worked the best in the past for that market.
That could also be done for daily and weekly breakout systems and virtually all technical indicators included in this book. Optimization allows technical parameters to adapt to changing market conditions.
Some argue that optimization helps their trading results and others that it doesn't.
The heart of the debate centers on how the data is optimized.
Researchers stress that the correct procedure is to use only part of the price data to choose the best parameters, and another portion to actually test the results.
Testing the optimized parameters on "out of sample" price data helps ensure that the final results will be closer to what one might experience from actual trading.
The decision to optimize or not is a personal one.
Most evidence, however, suggests that optimization is not the Holy Grail some think it to be.
I generally advise traders following only a handful of markets to experiment with optimization.
Why should Treasury Bonds or the German mark have the exact same moving averages as corn or cotton?
Stock market traders are a different story.
Having to follow thousands of stocks argues against optimizing.
If you specialize in a handful of markets, try optimizing.
If you're a generalist who follows a large number of markets, use the same technical parameters for all of them.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY

We've presented a lot of variations on the moving average approach.
Let's try to simplify things a bit.
Most technicians use a combination of two moving averages.
Those two averages are usually simple averages.
Although exponential averages have become popular, there's no real evidence to prove that they work any better than the simple average.
The most commonly used daily moving average combinations in futures markets are 4 and 9, 9 and 18, 5 and 20, and 10 and 40.
Stock traders rely heavily on a 5O day (or 10 week) moving average.
For longer range stock market analysis, popular weekly moving averages are 30 and 40 weeks (or 200 days).

Bollinger Bands make use of 20 day and 20 week moving averages.
The 20 week average can be converted to daily charts by utilizing a 100 day average, which is another useful moving average.
Channel breakout systems work extremely well in trending markets and can be used on daily, weekly, and monthly charts.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE ADAPTIVE MOVING AVERAGE

One of the problems encountered with the moving average is choosing between a fast or a slow average.
While one may work better in a trading range market, the other may be preferable in a trending market.
The answer to the problem of choosing between the two may lie with an innovative approach called the "adaptive moving average."
Perry Kaufman presents this technique in his book Smarter Trading.
The speed of Kaufman's "adaptive moving average" automatically adjusts to the level of noise (or volatility) in a market.
The AMA moves more slowly when markets are trending sideways, but then moves more swiftly when the market is trending.
That avoids the problem of using a faster moving average (and getting whipsawed more frequently) during a trading range, and using a slower average that trails too far behind a market when it is trending.
Kaufman does that by constructing an Efficiency Ratio that compares price direction with the level of volatility.
When the Efficiency Ratio is high, there is more direction than volatility (favoring a faster average).
When the ratio is low, there's more volatility than direction (favoring a slower average).
By incorporating the Efficiency Ratio, the AMA automatically adjusts to the speed most suitable for the current market.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALTERN ATIVES TO THE MOVING AVERAGE

Moving averages don't work all of the time.
They do their best work when the market is in a trending phase.
They're not very helpful during trendless periods when prices trade sideways.
Fortunately, there's another class of indicator that performs much better than the moving average during those frustrating trading ranges.
They're called oscillators and we'll explain them in the next chapter.
