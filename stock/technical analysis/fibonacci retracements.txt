markets usually retrace previous moves by certain predictable percentages, best known ones being 33%, 50%, and 67%.
fibonacci sequence refines those numbers a bit further.

most commonly used numbers for retracement:
	61.8% (usually rounded off to 62%)
	38%
	50%

in a strong trend, a minimum retracement is usually around 38%.
in a weak   trend, a maximum retracement is usually around 62%.

fibonacci ratios approach .618 only after the first four numbers, the first three ratios are:
	1/1 (100%)
	1/2 (50%)
	2/3 (66%)
the famous     50% retracement is actually a fibonacci ratio.
the two-thirds 66% retracement is also     a fibonacci ratio.
a complete retracement (100%) of a previous bull/bear market also should mark an important support/resistance area.
