an up   trendline is a straight line drawn upward   to the right along successive reaction lows.
a  down trendline is a straight line drawn downward to the right along successive rally    peaks.

a reaction is:
	a short-term downward movement of price after a period of upward movement.
	usually mild & slight decrease rather than large change.
	similar to a correction but lacks the same intensity/longevity.

two   points are needed to draw a          trendline.
a 3rd point  is  needed to make it a valid trendline.

a trend in motion will tend to remain in motion.
once a trend assumes a certain slope or rate of speed, it will usually maintain the same slope.

trendlines can:
	determine the end of corrective phases.
	tell us when the trend is changing.


corrective dips in uptrends will often touch or come very close to the up trendline. (cuz traders buy dips in uptrends)
the trendline provides a support boundary under the market that can be used as a buying area.
a down trendline can be used as a resistance area for selling purposes.
as long as the trendline is not violated, it can be used to determine buying and selling areas.

violation of the trendline signals a trend change.
breaking of the trendline is one of the best early warnings of a trend change. (very often)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
drawing a trendline

there must be evidence of a trend.
it always takes 2 points to draw any straight line.
for up trendline, there must be at least 2 reaction lows with second low higher than the first.
                        6
                       /
              4       / 
             /\      /  
      2     /  \    /   
     /\    /    \  /    
    /  \  /      \/     
\  /    \/        5
 \/      3
  1
be reasonably sure that a reaction low has been formed before identifying one.

formation of a reaction low

a reaction low is formed after prices begin to move higher from point 3.

confident levels of uptrend existence (before drawing a trendline):
	level 1:  a 50% retracement of wave 2-3
	level 2:  prices approach the top of wave 2
	level 3:  penetration of the peak at point 2

once 2 ascending lows have been identified, a straight line (tentative trendline) is drawn connecting the lows (points 1 and 3).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tentative vs valid

validity of a trendline is confirmed when a trendline is touched a third time and prices move higher again.
point 5 confirms the validity of the trendline.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
significance of a trendline

a trendline becomes more significant when:
	it has been intact for longer times
	it has been tested for more   times 

the more significant the trendline:
	the more confidence it inspires
	the more important is its penetration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
inclusion of price action

the correct drawing of a trendline should include the entire day's trading range, not only closing (and opening) prices.
including only opening/closing prices is not the more standard procedure but sometimes done.
closing price is the most important price of the day, but represents a small sample of day's activity,
including the day's price range takes into account all of the activity and is the more common usage.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
small trendline penetrations

when prices violate a trendline on an intraday basis, but then close in the direction of the original trend,
it creates doubt as to whether or not the trendline has been broken.

is original trendline still valid or a new line should be drawn?
	keep the original trendline, but draw a new dotted line until it can be better determined which is the truer line.
	ignore the minor breach, if subsequent market action proves that the original line is still valid.

remember there is no hard and fast rule to follow in such situations.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
valid breaking of trendlines

a close beyond the trendline is more significant than just an intraday penetration.
sometimes even a closing penetration is not enough.
determine what type of filter is best suited to the degree of trend being followed,
always make allowances for differences in individuals markets. (trader makes these decisions)
time and price filters are an attempt to isolate valid penetrations and eliminate bad signals (aka whipsaws):

price filters:
require trendlines to be broken by predetermined price increment or percentage amount.
too small filter:  do not reduces the impact of whipsaws.
too big   filter:  misses much of the initial move. (before a valid signal is given)

3% penetration:
	requires trendline to be broken on a closing basis by at least 3%.
	(prices have to close 3% below the price level where the line was broken.)
	used mainly for the breaking of longer term trendlines.
	not very appropriate for shorter term trading.
	does not apply to some financial markets. (e.g. interest rate markets)
	
1% penetration:
	requires trendline to be broken on a closing basis by at least 1%.
	it serves better for short term trendlines.
	sometimes it can be based on intraday basis for shorter term trendlines.

full point penetration
	require trendlines to be broken by a full dollar (etc) from price level where the line was broken.
	it ignores fractional moves.

time filters:
2 day rule
	prices must close beyond the trendline for 2 successive days. (days in a row)
	a one day violation would not count.

friday close
	require a friday close beyond a major breakout point to ensure a weekly signal.

The 1-3% rule and 2 day rule are also applied to the breaking of important support and resistance levels.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
reversal of roles

trendlines become the opposite once violated. (same as support/resistance)
(old trendlines act as support/resistance lines again in the future, but in opposite roles.)

in other words:
an up   trendline (a support line)    will usually become a resistance line once it's decisively broken.
a  down trendline (a resistance line) will usually become a support    line once it's decisively broken.

project all trendlines as far out to the right as possible even after they've been broken.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
measuring implications

when a trendline is broken, prices are expected to move to where they were when the trendline began.
it doesn't always happen, but it's an expectation.
similar to head and shoulders, where distance from "head" to "neckline" is projected beyond that line once it's broken.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fan principle

fan principle is another use of a trendline.

after a trendline is violated and another move in the direction of the trend has been tried and failed:
a second line is drawn based on the new low/high point,
if after another failed attempt at going back in the direction of the trend, prices breech the 2nd line as well,
a 3rd line is drawn based on the new point,
the breaking of the 3rd line is:
	an indication that prices are headed further away from the 3rd line and they may never come back near that level for a while/ever.
	a valid trend reversal signal

an example:
an up trendline is broken,
prices decline a bit, but then rally back (2nd line drawn) to the bottom of the broken trendline,
but they fail to penetrate that line and they decline again, this time below the 2nd line.
they decline a bit, then rally back (3rd line drawn) to the bottom of the 2nd line.
but they fail to penetrate that line and they decline again, this time below the 3rd line. (wich triggers the signal)

previously broken trendlines become support/resistance levels in subsequent declines/rallies.
in other words, if after breaking of 1st/2nd/3rd lines, prices move toward back to the 1st line,
they face support/resistance at the 3rd and 2nd line levels. (and also at the 1st line if they try to breach it)

the term "fan principle" derives from appearance of the lines that gradually flatten out, resembling a fan.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
importance of the number three

the number three plays a very important role throughout the entire field of technical analysis.

3 lines used in fan principle.
3 major phases in major bull/bear markets. (dow theory & elliott wave theory)
3 important peaks in triple top and head and shoulders. (reversal patterns)
3 kinds of gaps:                               breakaway,   runaway,   exhaustion.
3 different classifications of trend:          major,       secondary, minor.
3 trend directions:                            up,          down,      sideways.
3 types of triangles in continuation patterns: symmetrical, ascending, descending.
3 principle sources of information:            price,       volume,    open interest.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
relative steepness of the trendline

the relative steepness of the trendline is also important.
most important up trendlines tend to approximate an average slope of 45 degree.
a 45 degree line on the chart from a prominent high/low or previous tops/bottoms can be used as a major trendline.
45 degree line reflects a situation where prices are advancing/declining at such a rate that price and time are in perfect balance.

too steep trendline:
	indicates prices are advancing too rapidly and the current steep ascent will not be sustained. (rate of ascent is not sustainable)
	breaking of a steep trendline may be a reaction back to a more sustainable slope closer to the 45 degree line.

too flat  trendline:
	indicate the uptrend is too weak and not to be trusted.

45 degree line was one of the techniques favored by W. D. Gann.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
how to adjust trendlines

sometimes trendlines have to be adjusted to fit a slowing or an accelerating trend.
a trendline that is too far away from the price action is of little use in tracking the trend.
different trendlines are used to define the different degrees of trend.

if a steep trendline is broken, a slower trendline might have to be drawn.
if an original trendline is too flat, it may have to be redrawn at a steeper angle.
a moving average is the same as a curvilinear trendline.
resort to moving averages when steeper trendlines become necessary.

in an accelerating trend:
	several trendlines may have to be drawn at increasingly steeper angles.
	a moving average is more useful than a series of steeper and steeper trendlines.

just as there are several different degrees of trend in effect at any one time, so is there a need for different trendlines to measure those various trends.
a major up trendline connects low points of the major uptrend.
a shorter and more sensitive line might be used for secondary swings.
an even shorter line can measure the short term movements.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
internal trendlines

they are variations of the trendline that don't rely on extreme highs or lows.
instead, internal trendlines are drawn through the price action and connect as many internal peaks or troughs as possible.
some find them useful.

problem
drawing of internal trendlines is very subjective.
whereas the rules for drawing of traditional trendlines along extreme highs and lows are more exact.
