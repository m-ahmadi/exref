gaps are areas on the chart where no trading has taken place.
upside   gaps are signs of market strength.
downside gaps are signs of market weakness. (falling below a gap in an uptrend has very bearish implications.)
gaps on weekly and monthly charts are more significant than daily charts.
gaps are more common on daily charts than weekly and monthly charts.

in uptrend
prices open above the highest price of the previous day,
leaving a gap or open space that is not filled during the day.

in downtrend
the day's highest price is below the previous day's low.

3 general types of gaps:
	breakaway
	runaway (or measuring)
	exhaustion
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
myths
"gaps are always filled."
not true, some should be filled and others should not.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the breakaway gap

occurs at the completion of an important price pattern.
signals the beginning of a significant market move.
usually occur on heavy volume.
after a market has completed a major basing pattern, the breaking of resistance often occurs on a breakaway gap.

breeding grounds (where they appear a lot)
major breakouts from topping or basing areas.
the breaking of a major trendline, signaling a reversal of trend.

filling
breakaway gaps are usually not filled.
prices may return to upper end of the gap (in a bullish breakout), and may even close a portion of it, but some portion of it is often left unfilled.
the heavier the volume after this type of gap appears, the less likely it is to be filled.

measuring implications
upside gaps act as support areas on subsequent market corrections.
it's important that prices not fall below gaps during an uptrend.
a close below an upward gap is a sign of weakness.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the runaway or measuring gap

after a move has been underway for awhile, somewhere around middle of the move, prices will leap forward to form the runaway gap (or a series of gaps).

it's a sign that the market is moving effortlessly on moderate volume.

in uptrend
it's a sign of market strength.
a close below the runaway gap is a negative sign. (same as breakaway)

in downtrend
it's  a sign of weakness.

runaway gaps:
	act as support under the market on subsequent corrections
	are often not filled

measuring implications
it's called a measuring gap because it occurs at about the halfway point in a trend.
estimate the extent of the remaining move by by measuring the distance trend already traveled from original breakout and doubling that amount.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the exhaustion gap

it appears near the end of a market move.
it's expected to appear after the other two types of gaps (breakaway and runaway) have been identified and all objectives of the trend is achieved.

uptrend example
near the end of an uptrend, prices leap forward in a last gasp,
that upward leap quickly fades and prices turn lower within a couple of days or a week.
when prices close under that last gap, it's a dead giveaway that the exhaustion gap made its appearance.
this is a classic example where falling below a gap in an uptrend has very bearish implications.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the island reversal

this pattern is based on price gaps.
an upward exhaustion gap followed by a downward breakaway gap completes the pattern.

reading
when it's formed, it indicates a trend reversal of some magnitude.
significance of the reversal depends on where prices are in the general trend structure.

why the name
after the upward exhaustion gap has formed, prices will trade in a narrow range for a couple of days/weeks before gapping to the downside,
which leaves a few days of price action looking like an "island" surrounded by space or water.
