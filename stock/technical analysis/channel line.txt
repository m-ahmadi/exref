a channel forms when the price of an asset is moving between two parallel trendlines.
upper trendline connects the highs, lower trendline connects the lows.

channel line (aka return line) is another useful variation of the trendline technique. (channel line is a secondary use of the trendline technique.)

sometimes prices trend between two parallel lines, the basic trendline and the channel line.
detecting that a channel exists can be used to profitable advantage.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
how to draw: (in an uptrend)
	draw basic up trendline along the lows.
	draw a dotted line from first important peak, parallel to the basic up trendline.
	both lines move up to the right, forming a channel.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
how to confirm channel exist
	level 1:    next rally reaches and backs off from the channel line.
	level 2:    prices drop back to the original trendline.

(same for a downtrend but in opposite direction.)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
usage
up trendline can be used to initiate new long positions.
channel line can be used for short term profit taking.
channel line can be used to initiate a countertrend short position. (trading in opposite direction of current trend can be a dangerous tactic)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
significance
a channel becomes more important and reliable when:
	the longer it remains intact
	the more often it is successfully tested
	(same as basic trendline)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
breaking

the breaking of the major trendline indicates an important change in trend.
the breaking of a rising channel line has exactly the opposite meaning, and signals an acceleration of the existing trend.
reaching the upper line in an uptrend could be a reason to add to long positions.

in an uptrend
failure of prices to reach the top of the channel:
	usually a sign of a weakening trend.
	early warning that the trend is turning.
	increases the odds that the other line (the basic up trendline) will be broken.

general rule of thumb
the failure of any move within an established price channel to reach one side of the channel:
	usually indicates that the trend is shifting.
	increases the likelihood that the other side of the channel will be broken.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
adjustment

the channel can be used to adjust the basic trendline.
if prices move above a projected rising channel line by a significant amount, it usually indicates a strengthening trend.

upward
after channel is breached, draw a steeper basic up trendline from the last reaction low parallel to the new channel line.
the new steeper trend (support) line functions better than the old flatter line.

downward
failure of an uptrend to reach the upper end of a channel justifies the drawing of a 
new support line under the last reaction low parallel to the new resistance line over the past two peaks.
in other words, when prices fail to reach the upper channel line:
	a down trendline is drawn over the two declining peaks.
	a tentative channel line can be drawn from the first low point parallel to trendline.
	the lower channel line sometimes indicates where initial support will be evident.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
measuring implications
once a breakout occurs from an existing price channel, prices usually travel a distance equal to the width of the channel.
measure the width of the channel and then project that amount from the point at which either trendline is broken.
the basic trendline is by far the more important and reliable line than the channel line.
