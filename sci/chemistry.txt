mixture		combination of 2|N substances
		each substance retains its own chemical identity
		e.g. salt+water, sugar+salt

compound	chemical substance with many identical molecules
		molecules with atoms from many chemical elements
		everything is held together by chemical bonds
		e.g. water
		
molecule	made-up of atoms of 1|N elements
		1 atom-type:		2 oxygen atoms = O2
		N atom-type:		protein

periodic table	rows & columns arrangement of chemical elements
		rows:			periods
		columns:		groups
		blocks:			4 rectangles which table is divided into
		periodic law:		periodic dependence of elements on their atomic numbers
		elements of same group have similar characteristics

element		chemical substance which cannot be broken down into other substances (pure)
		made-up of one type of atom
		2 types of elements:	natural (oxygen, nitrogen, carbon) & synthetic

atom		basic unit of matter
		central nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons
		nucleus contains protons and neutrons
		electrons revolve around nucleus in different orbits

subatomic particles
		electron		+  charge
		proton			-  charge
		neutron			no charge

nucleus		central part of atom
		particles inside are called nucleons (protons & neutrons)
		has + charge
