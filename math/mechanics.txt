load

a force, deformation or acceleration applied to structural elements

dead			static force (constant over time)
live			moving force (may involve: impact, momentum, vibration, fluid slosh dynamics)
impact			force applied over short time (less than 1/3 of total vibration time)
cyclic			repeated force
axial			force along an axis (aka normal force)
lateral			force on side
shear			force on 1 end only
radial			force in radial direction

misc

tensile strength	max stress a material can stand against tension or compression force
shear strength		...                             against shear                  force
yield point		point on stress-strain curve where elastic becomes plastic (materials science)
stiffness		object's resistance to elastic deformation under stress
young's modulus		measure of tensile or compressive stiffness of a solid material when force applied lengthwise (stress รท strain)


column			structural element that carries axial   load
beam			structural element that carries lateral load

bending moment		places accross the beam where torque force is in action
reaction moment		...                           normal force ...

torque (moment)		rotational equivalent of linear force

support types		prevents					allows
	pinned		vertical & horizontal displacement		rotation
	roller		vertical displacement				horizontal displacement & rotation
	fixed		all displacements & rotation			---
	spring		total disconnect from foundation		slight movement

concentrated force	force that is in a small section         of whole area
distributed force	force that is spreaded in larger section of whole area

ductility

how much a material can sustain plastic deformation under tensile stress before failing

brittle			breaks clean into two
ductile			deforms then breaks
super ductile		almost turns into wire, then breaks
