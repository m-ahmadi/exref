aka serial correlation

correlation between observations of a random variable as a function of time lag between them

when two (or more) items of a time-series contain the same information

uncorrelated does not necessarily mean random
	data with    autocorrelation is not random
	data without autocorrelation can still have non-randomness (in other ways)
	autocorrelation is just one measure of randomness

autocorrelation plot

a tool for checking randomness in data

randomness is ascertained by computing autocorrelations at varying time lags
	at each time lag d, it computes correlation between X(t) and X(t-d)

if random
	autocorrelation values are near zero for all lags
if non-random
	one or more autocorrelation values are significantly non-zero
