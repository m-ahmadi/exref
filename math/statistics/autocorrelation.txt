aka serial correlation, acf

correlation between observations of a random variable as a function of time lag between them

when two (or more) items of a time-series contain the same information

uncorrelated does not necessarily mean random
	data with    autocorrelation is not random
	data without autocorrelation can still have non-randomness (in other ways)
	autocorrelation is just one measure of randomness

partial autocorrelation (pacf)
	acf measures linear relationship between Y[t-d] and Y[t] (including linear influence of in-between items)
	pacf ignores variables that lie between Y[t-d] and Y[t]
	pacf is useful for determining the order in AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA models

autocorrelation plot

a tool for checking randomness in data

randomness is ascertained by computing autocorrelations at varying time lags
	at each time lag d, it computes correlation between Y[t] and Y[t-d]

if random
	autocorrelation values are near zero for all lags
if non-random
	one or more autocorrelation values are significantly non-zero
