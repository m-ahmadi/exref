1. write three questions you're trying to decide

	"which mortgage professional should i choose?"

2. write up 5 or 6 "must-have qualities"

	attr (quality)				description
	=========================================================
	integrity				(what he says is consistent with what he does)
	professional knowledge and expertise	(makes recommendations consistent with what i value)
	quality of communication		(helps me understand quickly)
	accessibility				(i can reach them when i need them)
	competitive pricing			(rates and costs are amongst the best in the marketplace)
	reliability of recommendations		(shows me that live market data is consistent with recommendations so i can make a timely decision to choose them)
	
3. rate the importance of each of these qualities on a scale of 1 to 10 in terms of how important each is to you.
	(if "reliability" is far more important than anything, it gets a 10,
	if "competitive pricing" is the second most important but really not nearly as important as "reliability" you might give it a 5 or 6, and so on)
	
	attr					importance score
	=========================================================
	integrity				4
	professional knowledge and expertise	2
	quality of communication		1
	accessibility				2
	competitive pricing			6
	reliability of recommendations		9

4. list your options
	bank loan officer
	realtor referred
	my current loan broker

5. rate each option on a scale of 1 to 10 for each quality you put down for that option
	(if your current loan broker rates are good with you, give them an 8, but if you think they are average, give them a 5.)
	this is a subjective scale, so it's up to you to score it as honestly as possible to make the best decision by the end of this process.
	
	attr scores			attr1	attr2	attr3	attr4	attr5	attr6
	=================================================================================
	bank loan officer		0	2	3	4	5	6
	realtor referred		8	5	6	2	8	2
	my current loan broker		6	2	4	3	8	9

6. compute scores for each option by multiplying the quality score you gave your option with your target quality score, the one you created in step 3.
	(for example, your loan broker scores 56 in integrity: 8 [the importance of integrity] x 7 [how well you rate them in that area]).

					attr1	attr2	attr3	attr4	attr5	attr6
	=================================================================================
	bank loan officer		0x4	2x3	3x1	4x2	5x6	6x9
	realtor referred		8x4	5x3	6x1	2x2	8x6	2x9
	my current loan broker		6x4	2x3	4x1	3x2	8x6	9x9
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	bank loan officer		4	6	3	8	30	54
	realtor referred		32	15	6	4	48	18
	my current loan broker		24	6	4	6	48	81

7. sum up the scores for each quality for a total score for that option. compute a separate score for each option.
	
	bank loan officer		105	(4  + 6  + 3 + 8 + 30 + 54)
	realtor referred		123	(32 + 15 + 6 + 4 + 48 + 18)
	my current loan broker		169	(24 + 6  + 4 + 6 + 48 + 81)

8. decide on a target score
	target_score
	how to come up with it: "Figure out the ideal 'solution' and tally that up"
	note: analogous to sum_of_weights in weighted average

9. divide each option's total score by your target score and multiply by 100 to get a percentage score.
	the option with the highest score (compared to your target) is your best choice.
	
	bank loan officer		(105 / target_score) * 100
	realtor referred		(123 / target_score) * 100
	my current loan broker		(169 / target_score) * 100
	
	eg target_score = 50
	bank loan officer		210	( (105 / 50) * 100 )
	realtor referred		246	( (123 / 50) * 100 )
	my current loan broker		338	( (169 / 50) * 100 )
