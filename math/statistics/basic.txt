mean		normal average (sum(numbers) / numbers.length)

median		middle value in the list of ascending-sorted numbers (mean of two middle values if list is even)

mode		most occurred value in a list of numbers (no repeated numbers = no mode)

range		difference between largest and smallest values in a list of numbers (max - min)
midrange	mean(min,max)

iqr		difference betwwen median of first and second half of list (if list is odd, median of list is excluded from halves)

types of statistics
	descriptive:	making information that describes the data in some manner
	inferential:	making conclusions about the data, using only some part of it

distribution moments
	location	first  moment
	variability	second moment
	skewness	third  moment	(whether data is skewed to larger or smaller values)
	kurtosis	fourth moment	(propensity of the data to have extreme values)

frequency table
	variable range devided into equally spaced segments with count of values in each segment
	histogram is a way to visualize a frequency table

bar chart vs histogram
	bar chart:	x-axis represents sub-variables of variable (bars shown separate from each other)
	histogram:	x-axis represents values        of variable (bars shown touching each other, with gaps for non-existing values)
		
density plot
	a continuous line that shows distribution of data values
	like a smoothed histogram

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
correlation does not imply causation
	causation:	a causal relationship between variables
	correlation:	variables reflect the same pattern,
	changes in one won't affect the other

curse of dimensionality
	analyzing too many variables
