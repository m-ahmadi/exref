types of data
	quantitative:		numbers, can be measured. (hight, width, temperature, humidity, price)
		discrete:	finite, integers, whole things, indivisible entities. children (can't have 2.5 kids)
		continuous:	infinite, divisible to finer levels. weight (can be on more precise scales: meter,centi,milli,...)
	qualitative:		categorical, characteristics, descriptors, can't be measured. (smells, tastes, textures, colors)
		binomial:	binary
		nominal:	unordered
		ordinal:	ordered
	time series:		successive measurements of same variable in time order
	spacial data:		representing objects and their spatial coordinates (used in mapping and location analytics)
	graph data:		representing relationships (physical, social, abstract)

types of statistics
	descriptive:	making information that describes the data in some manner
	inferential:	making conclusions about the data, using only some part of it
	nonparametric:	not using parameters of probability distribution (mean, stdv, etc)

types of analysis
	univariate	one variable
	bivariate	two variables
	multivariate	more than two variables

distribution moments
	location	first  moment
	variability	second moment
	skewness	third  moment	(whether data is skewed to larger or smaller values)
	kurtosis	fourth moment	(propensity of the data to have extreme values)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
univariate analysis

mean		normal average (sum(numbers) / numbers.length)

median		middle value in the list of ascending-sorted numbers (mean of two middle values if list is even)

mode		most occurred value in a list of numbers (no repeated numbers = no mode)

range		difference between largest and smallest values in a list of numbers (max - min)
midrange	mean(min,max)

iqr		difference betwwen median of first and second half of list (if list is odd, median of list is excluded from halves)

standard deviation
	how spread the data is
	the lower the standard deviation  =  the closer values are to mean

frequency table
	variable range devided into equally spaced segments with count of values in each segment
	histogram is a way to visualize a frequency table

bar chart vs histogram
	bar chart:	x-axis represents sub-variables of variable (bars separate from each other)
	histogram:	x-axis represents values        of variable (bars touching each other, with gaps for non-existing values)
		
density plot
	a continuous line that shows distribution of data values
	like a smoothed histogram
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bivariate analysis

scatter plot
	relationship between 2 numeric variables (each on 1 axis)
	the larger the sample size  =  the less useful is scatter plot (due to clutter)

correlation
	how much 2 variables are linearly related
	correlation does not imply causation
		causation:	a causal relationship between variables
		correlation:	variables reflect the same pattern
		changes in one won't affect the other
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
multivariate analysis

boxplot
	compare distributions of 1 numeric variable grouped according to 1 categorical variable

violin plot
	enhancement to the boxplot
	plot density estimate with density on y-axis (with a flip mirror which resembles a violin)

contingency table
	table of counts by category for 2 categorical variables

==================================================
two-dimensional density (natural analogs to histograms and density plots)

hexagonal binning
	data is grouped into hexagonal bins with a color indicating number of values in that bin
	
contour plot
	topographical map to two variables
	each contour band represents a specific density of points, increasing as one nears a "peak"
heatmap
	data is grouped into bins with a color indicating number of values in that bin
	color can vary by hue or intensity

curse of dimensionality
	analyzing too many variables
