time series features

mean, stdv, ...
slope (of linregres)
amplitude		diff from center
wavelength		length of 1 cycle
cycle			from a point till reaches back to same point (after going in both directions)
period			time it takes to complete 1 cycle
frequency		number of cycles occurred in 1 unit (1/period)

types of processes

stochastic		process that appear to vary in random manner
stationary		mean & variance do not change over time
	strong		both mean & variance do not vary (aka strict-sense)
	weak		only mean & autocovariance do not vary but variance can vary (aka covariance-stationary, wide-sense)
	trend		stochastic process that becomes stationary when trend removed
	Nth-order	only up to certain order N remain stationary (weaker than weak)
non-stationary		mean & variance change over time
cyclostationary		statistical properties that vary cyclically with time
unit root		non-stationary process that does not always have a trend (aka difference-stationary)

autocorrelation
	correlation of a signal with a delayed copy of itself as a function of delay
autocovariance
	given a stochastic process, a function that gives covariance of process with itself at pairs of time points
