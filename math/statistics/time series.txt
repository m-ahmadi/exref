time series features

mean, stdv, ...
slope (of linregres)
amplitude		diff from center
wavelength		length of 1 cycle
cycle			from a point till reaches back to same point (after going in both directions)
period			time it takes to complete 1 cycle
frequency		number of cycles occurred in 1 unit (1/period)

stationary time series
	statistical properties of series do not change (mean and variance)
	series value changes, but the way it changes remains the same (repeating a pattern)
