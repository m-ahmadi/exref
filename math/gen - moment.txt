moments of a function are quantitative measures related to shape of function's graph

for example:

function representing mass density
	zeroth moment		total mass
	first moment		center of mass
	second moment		moment of inertia

function is probabilty distribution
	first moment		expected value
	second moment		variance
	third moment		skewness
	fourth moment		kurtosis
