independent events		occurrence of one event does not affect probability of occurrence of the other
conditional probability		probability of an  event  occurring, given that another event has already occurred
joint probability		probability of two events occurring together

bayes theory
	P(A|B) = P(A) * P(B|A) / P(B)

probability distribution	probability of possible values of a variable
				number of times each possible value of a variable occurs in the dataset (like a frequency table)
				it's an idealized frequency distribution

probability density function	probability distribution of a continuous variable
probability mass    function	probability distribution of a discrete   variable
