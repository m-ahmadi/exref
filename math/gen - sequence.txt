a sequence is an enumerated collection of things
	(enumerated means all items are explicitly listed and not defined by a property or rule)

like a set, it contains elements (aka members or terms)
unlike a set, same elements can appear multiple times at different positions
unlike a set, order does matter

number of elements is called the length of the sequence
