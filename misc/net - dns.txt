A	address
	maps fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to an IPv4 address
	acts as translator by converting domain names to IP adresses

AAAA	quad A
	similar to A records but maps to an IPv6 adress (smart phones prefer IPv6, if available)

ANAME	allows to point root of domain to a hostname or FQDN

CNAME	canonical name
	an alias that points to another domain or subdomain, but never an IP address
	alias record mapping FQDN to FQDN, multiple hosts to a single location
	good for changing an IP address over time since allows to make changes without affecting user bookmarks, etc

SOA	start of authority
	stores information about domains and is used to direct how a DNS zone propagates to secondary name servers

NS	name server
	specifies which name servers are authoritative for a domain or subdomains
	should not be pointed to a CNAME

MX	mail exchange
	uses mail servers to map where to deliver email for a domain
	should point to a mail server name and not to an IP address

TXT	text
	allows administrators to add limited human and machine-readable notes
	can be used for email validation, site, and ownership verification, framework policies, etc
	doesn't require specific formatting

SRV	service
	allows services such as instant messaging or VoIP to be directed to a separate host and port location

SPF	sender policy framework
	helps prevent email spoofing and limits spammers

PTR	pointer
	a reverse of A and AAAA records
	maps IP addresses to domain names
	requires domain authority and can't exist in same zone as other DNS record types (put in reverse zones)
