							CGI

Each Web server runs HTTP server software, which responds to requests from Web browsers.
Generally, the HTTP server has a directory (folder),
which is designated as a document collection � files that can be sent to Web browsers connected to this server

For example
if the Web server has the domain name example.com,
and its document collection is stored at /usr/local/apache/htdocs in the local file system,
then the Web server will respond to a request for http://example.com/index.html by
sending to the browser the (pre-written) file /usr/local/apache/htdocs/index.html.

CGI extends this system by allowing the owner of the Web server to designate a directory within the
document collection as containing executable scripts (or binary files) instead of pre-written pages;
this is known as a CGI directory.

For example
/usr/local/apache/htdocs/cgi-bin could be designated as a CGI directory on the Web server.
If a Web browser requests a URL that points to a file within the CGI directory
(e.g., http://example.com/cgi-bin/printenv.pl), then,
instead of simply sending that file
(/usr/local/apache/htdocs/cgi-bin/printenv.pl) to the Web browser,
the HTTP server runs the specified script and passes the output of the script to the Web browser.
That is, anything that the script sends to standard output is passed to the Web client instead of
being shown on-screen in a terminal window.



CGI allows Web browser to send information to script via:
	URL
	HTTP POST request

Via URL (stored before script is called)
	PATH_INFO
		site.com/t.php/something_blue		PATH_INFO = "/something_blue" (environment variable)
	HTTP GET request
		site.com/t.php?param=value&ano=a	QUERY_STRING = "param=value&ano=a"
							$_GET     in php
							res.query in node
via HTTP POST request
	parameters are passed to the script's standard input.
	script can then read these environment variables or data from standard input

						Problems with CGI

Calling a command generally means the invocation of a newly created process on the server.
Starting the process can consume much more time and memory than the actual work of generating the output,
especially when the program still needs to be interpreted or compiled.
If the command is called often, the resulting workload can quickly overwhelm the server.

The overhead involved in interpretation may be reduced by using compiled CGI programs,
such as those in C/C++, rather than using Perl or other interpreted languages.
The overhead involved in process creation can be reduced by techniques such as
	FastCGI which "prefork" interpreter processes
	running the application code entirely within the web server, using extension modules such as mod_php



Several approaches can be adopted for remedying this:

	The popular Web servers developed their own extension mechanisms that allows third-party software to
	run inside the web server itself, such as Apache modules, NSAPI plugins and ISAPI plugins.

	Simple Common Gateway Interface or SCGI

	FastCGI allows a single, long-running process to handle more than one user request while
	keeping close to the CGI programming model, retaining the simplicity while
	eliminating the overhead of creating a new process for each request.
	Unlike converting an application to a web server plug-in,
	FastCGI applications remain independent of the web server.


	Replacement of the architecture for dynamic websites can also be used.
	This is the approach taken by Java EE, which runs Java code in a Java servlet container in order
	to serve dynamic content and optionally static content.
	This approach replaces the overhead of generating and destroying processes with
	the much lower overhead of generating and destroying threads,
	and also exposes the programmer to the library that comes with Java Platform,
	Standard Edition on which the version of Java EE in use is based.

The optimal configuration for any Web application depends on
	application-specific details
	amount of traffic
	complexity of the transaction

these tradeoffs need to be analyzed to determine the best implementation for a given task and time budget
