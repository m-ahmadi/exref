Apache 		process-based, thread-based or event-based as determined by the MPM used
nginx 		event-based web server
node.js		event-based

Nginx and Lighttpd are probably the two best-known asynchronous servers and
Apache is undoubtedly the best known originally process-based server

The main advantage of the asynchronous approach is scalability.
In a process-based server, each simultaneous connection requires a thread which incurs significant overhead.
An asynchronous server, on the other hand, is event-driven and handles requests in a single (or at least, very few) threads.

While a process-based server can often perform on par with an asynchronous server under light loads,
under heavier loads they usually consume far more RAM which significantly degrades performance.
Also, they degrade much faster on less powerful hardware or in a resource-restricted environment such as a VPS.
