Class diagrams from a software perspective. These show the classes in the software and how
they interrelate.

Sequence diagrams for common scenarios. A valuable approach is to pick the most important
and interesting scenarios from the use cases and use CRC cards or sequence diagrams to
figure out what happens in the software.

Package diagrams to show the large-scale organization of the software.

State diagrams for classes with complex life histories.

Deployment diagrams to show the physical layout of the software.
