nodes on an activity diagram are called actions, not activities.
strictly, an activity refers to a sequence of actions, so the diagram shows an activity that's made up of actions.

the principal difference between them and flowchart notation is that they support parallel behavior

black circle		initial node
black bar		fork/join (a fork has one incoming flow and several outgoing concurrent flows)
action			rounded rectangle
decision/merge		diamond
