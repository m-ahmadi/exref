shape: rectangle

consist of some region of a sequence diagram that is divided into one or more fragments
each frame has an operator and each fragment may have a guard

common frame operators:

alt (if else)	Alternative multiple fragments; only the one whose condition is true will execute.
opt (if)	Optional; the fragment executes only if the supplied condition is true. Equivalent to an alt with only one trace.
par		Parallel; each fragment is run in parallel.
loop		Loop; the fragment may execute multiple times, and the guard indicates the basis of iteration.
region		Critical region; the fragment can have only one thread executing it at once.
neg		Negative; the fragment shows an invalid interaction.
ref		Reference; refers to an interaction defined on another diagram. The frame is drawn to cover the lifelines involved in the interaction. You can define parameters and a return value.
sd		Sequence diagram; used to surround an entire sequence diagram, if you wish.
