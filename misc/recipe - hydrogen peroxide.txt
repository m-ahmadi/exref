hydrogen peroxide is water (H2O) with an extra oxygen molecule (H2O2)
the extra oxygen molecule oxidizes, which is how peroxide gets its power

medical-grade:	peroxide=3% water=97%
food-grade:	peroxide=35%
	toxic to inhale, irritates skin & eyes
	not necessary for cleaning and disinfecting

extra oxygen breaks down over time
stays full strength for 3 years in brown container
once opened, only effective for a few months
once not foaming anymore (no bubbles), it's just water
use in a well-ventilated area and wear gloves (not sure, for 3% or 35% ?)
use inside solid-colored bottles (no exposure to light)
do not use on wounds or acne
do not mix with vinegar (produces peracetic acid with harmful vapors)
to discard, pour in sink
