butterfly

two kicks for every stroke cycle
	1. when hands enter water
		less forceful
		for maintaing body position (like preventing legs to go under water too much)
	2. when hands exit water
		must be powerful
		for maintaining momentum (keep you traveling forward as head is lifted to breathe)

breathing
	lift head as hands are pulling water (hands are near waste)
	lift head only enough to get air (chin should remain in water)
	ideal is to breath every other stroke (but fine if breathe every stroke)
