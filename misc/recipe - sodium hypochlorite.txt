aka "bleach"
found in "Clorox" products
usually in concentration of 5%
never mix with "hydrochloric acid" (جوهرنمک) as it produces "chlorine gas" which is poisonous
works most effectively in hot water (oxidizes quickly)
use cold water for solutions as it looses its potency in hot water quickly (cuz you have no time to apply)
could damage ceramic glazing if used regularly
could corrode pipes if poured in toilet regularly
