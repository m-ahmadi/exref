aka "bleach", found in commercial products like "Clorox", usually in concentration of 5%
note that bleaching powder is "calcium hypochlorite" and has 65-70% chlorine content
use in well-ventilated area
do not use on metal (except steel)
do not use on clothes of type: wool|silk|leather|synthetic-fabric
could damage ceramic glazing if used regularly
could corrode pipes if poured in toilet regularly
never use directly on clothes (must be diluted)
never mix with "hydrochloric acid" (or any acid) as it produces "chlorine gas" which is poisonous
oxidizes very fast in hot water
use cold water for solutions as it looses potency in hot water quickly (before you have time to apply)
use 1% solution within 1 month of creation (store in cool dark place and inside air-tight container)
