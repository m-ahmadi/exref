it's basically a way of encoding binary data in ascii text.

sending binary data over a network in a raw format causes problems:

	some protocols may interpret binary data as control characters (like a modem),
	underlying protocol might corrupted the binary data because it thinks you've entered a special character combination (ftp line endings translation)

So to get around this, we encode the binary data into characters.
base64 is one of these types of encodings.

base64 is widely used because the 64 characters exist in many character sets.
