1. corral your crap
	place things on a tray, group objects in groups of three
2. velvet hangers
	uniform, clothes don't fall off
3. drop zones -> ease of maintenance
	intentional drop zones, where are you naturally dropping stuff?
4. tiered lazy susan -> ease of access
	toiletries and cosmetics
5. active zones vs passive zones
	entrance vs. guest bedroom,
	spare light bulbs go in the passive zone
	melon bowler in the back of the cabinet
	everyday products in arm's reach
6. maximize weirdo spaces
	designed vignette or storage space
	hang up purses between wall and closet (valet rod)
	(magic eraser is magic)
7. closed storage
	open storage usually more for decor than actual storage,
	glassware, books
8. subdivide 
	especially junkdrawers, use shoes boxes or similar
9. purge - remove clutter
	1. 15 min declutter
	2. if it takes longer than 5 min to tidy a room, p u r g e
	3. designate a day of the week
10. let go of the guilt of letting go
	how much work would it take to revive this?
