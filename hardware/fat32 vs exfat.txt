windows "Format" from context menu only shows:
	FAT32:	drives smaller than 32 GB
	exFAT:	drives larger  than 32 GB
--------------------------------------------------
format drives larger than 32 GB as FAT32

fat32format utility		worked
compmgmt.msc			fail (only shows exFAT)
format F: /fs:FAT32 /q		fail (The volume is too big for FAT32)
