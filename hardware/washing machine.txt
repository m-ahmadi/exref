to level:
	1. zero out the back legs (or do not touch them)
	2. level using only the front legs
	3. level along width axis (sit in front of machine (where door is), place level on top)
	4. slant slightly toward the back wall (along length axis)

	note: the reason machine should be slanted slightly toward the back wall is so
	that water does not pour out of the drum and the door does not swing open by itself

adjust leg:
	upper nut locks the current height
	lower nut adjusts height
