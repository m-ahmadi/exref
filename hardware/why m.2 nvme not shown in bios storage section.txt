because nvme ssd connects directly to cpu through pci bus

TLDR
The Storage Configuration screen receives its information from the chipset only, not the PCIe lanes/interface.
The SATA ports are provided by the chipset.
If you used a SATA M.2 SSD, which uses the SATA/chipset resources, it would be shown in Storage Configuration.
Your NVME M.2 SSD is connected to the PCIe lanes from the CPU, nothing related to the chipset.
It is normal for an NVMe M.2 SSD to not be shown in Storage Configuration with your board.
